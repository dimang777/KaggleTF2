# Using BERT in Keras with tensorflow hub
Following on our [previous demo using ELMo embeddings in Keras with tensorflow hub](https://github.com/strongio/keras-elmo), we present a brief demonstration on how to integrate BERT from tensorflow hub into a custom Keras layer that can be directly integrated into a Keras or tensorflow model.
