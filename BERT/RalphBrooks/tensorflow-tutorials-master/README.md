The following tutorials show how to create a NLP classifier that achieves 84% accuracy on the classification of Yelp store reviews with 738 training examples. 


This repository consists of the following:

1-Construct-TensorFlow-Data-Pipeline.ipynb - This is a Jupyter notebook created in AWS Sagemaker that shows how to create a data pipeline in Tensorflow.

2-Sentiment-Classification-with-BERT.ipynb - This is a Jupyter notebook that takes information created in 1-TFRecord and uses it as the basis of a NLP classifier. This notebook
utilizes [Huggingface's Transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) and a language model called [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805).

3-How-to-use-Saved-Model.ipynb - This is some example code that shows how to utilize a TensorFlow SavedModel. 

bert_config.json - This contains the parameters that configure the Huggingface library.
