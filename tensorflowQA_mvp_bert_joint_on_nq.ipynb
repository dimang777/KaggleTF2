In its broadest sense , every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing . It usually involves using email to send advertisements , request business , or solicit sales or donations , and is meant to build loyalty , trust , or brand awareness . Marketing emails can be sent to a purchased lead list or a current customer database . The term usually refers to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing a merchant 's relationship with current or previous customers , encouraging customer loyalty and repeat business , acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately , and sharing third - party ads . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Types <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Transactional emails </Li> <Li> 2.2 Direct emails <Ul> <Li> 2.2. 1 Mobile email marketing </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Comparison to traditional mail <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Advantages </Li> <Li> 3.2 Disadvantages </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Opt - in email advertising </Li> <Li> 5 Legal requirements <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Australia </Li> <Li> 5.2 Canada </Li> <Li> 5.3 European Union </Li> <Li> 5.4 United States </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History </H2> <P> Email marketing has evolved rapidly alongside the technological growth of the 21st century . Prior to this growth , when emails were novelties to the majority of customers , email marketing was not as effective . In 1978 , Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) sent out the first mass email to approximately 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ( ARPANET ) . This email resulted in $13 million worth of sales in DEC products , and highlighted the potential of marketing through mass emails . However , as email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication , users began blocking out content from emails with filters and blocking programs . In order to effectively communicate a message through email , marketers had to develop a way of pushing content through to the end user , without being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software . This resulted in the birth of triggered marketing emails , which are sent to specific users based on their tracked online browsing patterns . </P> <P> Historically , it has been difficult to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns because target markets can not be adequately defined . Email marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns on investment and measure and improve efficiency . Email marketing allows marketers to see feedback from users in real time , and to monitor how effective their campaign is in achieving market penetration , revealing a communication channel 's scope . At the same time , however , it also means that the more personal nature of certain advertising methods , such as television advertisements , can not be captured . </P> <H2> Types </H2> <P> Email marketing can be carried out through different types of emails : </P> <H3> Transactional emails </H3> <P> Transactional emails are usually triggered based on a customer 's action with a company . To be qualified as transactional or relationship messages , these communications ' primary purpose must be `` to facilitate , complete , or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient has previously agreed to enter into with the sender '' along with a few other narrow definitions of transactional messaging . Triggered transactional messages include dropped basket messages , password reset emails , purchase or order confirmation emails , order status emails , reorder emails , and email receipts . </P> <P> The primary purpose of a transactional email is to convey information regarding the action that triggered it . But , due to their high open rates ( 51.3 % compared to 36.6 % for email newsletters ) , transactional emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email relationship with customers or subscribers ; to anticipate and answer questions ; or to cross-sell or up - sell products or services . </P> <P> Many email newsletter software vendors offer transactional email support , which gives companies the ability to include promotional messages within the body of transactional emails . There are also software vendors that offer specialized transactional email marketing services , which include providing targeted and personalized transactional email messages and running specific marketing campaigns ( such as customer referral programs ) . </P> <H3> Direct emails </H3> <P> Direct email involves sending an email solely to communicate a promotional message ( for example , a special offer or a product catalog ) . Companies usually collect a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send direct promotional messages to , or they rent a list of email addresses from service companies . Safe mail marketing is also used . </P> Mobile email marketing <P> Email marketing develops large amounts of traffic through smartphones and tablets . Marketers are researching ways to advertise to more users and to make them view advertising for longer . However , the rate of delivery is still relatively low due to better filtering - out of advertising and users having multiple email accounts for different purposes . Because emails are generated according to the tracked behavior of consumers , it is possible to send advertising which is based on the recipient 's behavior . Because of this , modern email marketing is perceived more often as a pull strategy rather than a push strategy . </P> <H2> Comparison to traditional mail </H2> <P> There are both advantages and disadvantages to using email marketing in comparison to traditional advertising mail . </P> <H3> Advantages </H3> <P> Email marketing is popular with companies for several reasons : </P> <Ul> <Li> An exact return on investment can be tracked ( `` track to basket '' ) and has proven to be high when done properly . Email marketing is often reported as second only to search marketing as the most effective online marketing tactic . </Li> <Li> Email marketing is significantly cheaper and faster than traditional mail , mainly because of the high cost and time required in a traditional mail campaign for producing the artwork , printing , addressing , and mailing . </Li> <Li> Businesses and organizations who send a high volume of emails can use an ESP ( email service provider ) to gather information about the behavior of the recipients . The insights provided by consumer response to email marketing help businesses and organizations understand and make use of consumer behavior . </Li> <Li> Email provides a cost - effective method to test different marketing content , including visual , creative , marketing copy , and multimedia assets . The data gathered by testing in the email channel can then be used across all channels of marketing campaigns , both print and digital . </Li> <Li> Advertisers can reach substantial numbers of email subscribers who have opted in ( i.e. , consented ) to receive the email . </Li> <Li> Almost half of American Internet users check or send email on a typical day , with emails delivered between 1 am and 5 am local time outperforming those sent at other times in open and click rates . </Li> <Li> Email is popular with digital marketers , rising an estimated 15 % in 2009 to \\u00a3 292 million in the UK . </Li> <Li> If compared to standard email , direct email marketing produces higher response rate and higher average order value for e-commerce businesses . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Disadvantages </H3> <P> As of mid-2016 email deliverability is still an issue for legitimate marketers . According to the report , legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73 % in the U.S. ; six percent were filtered as spam , and 22 % were missing . This lags behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and Brazil at 79 % . </P> <P> Additionally , consumers receive on average circa 90 emails per day . </P> <P> Companies considering the use of an email marketing program must make sure that their program does not violate spam laws such as the United States ' Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act ( CAN - SPAM ) , the European Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 , or their Internet service provider 's acceptable use policy . </P> <H2> Opt - in email advertising </H2> <P> Opt - in email advertising , or permission marketing , is a method of advertising via email whereby the recipient of the advertisement has consented to receive it . This method is one of several developed by marketers to eliminate the disadvantages of email marketing . </P> <P> Opt - in email marketing may evolve into a technology that uses a handshake protocol between the sender and receiver . This system is intended to eventually result in a high degree of satisfaction between consumers and marketers . If opt - in email advertising is used , the material that is emailed to consumers will be `` anticipated '' . It is assumed that the recipient wants to receive it , which makes it unlike unsolicited advertisements sent to the consumer . Ideally , opt - in email advertisements will be more personal and relevant to the consumer than untargeted advertisements . </P> <P> A common example of permission marketing is a newsletter sent to an advertising firm 's customers . Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions , or new products . In this type of advertising , a company that wants to send a newsletter to their customers may ask them at the point of purchase if they would like to receive the newsletter . </P> <P> With a foundation of opted - in contact information stored in their database , marketers can send out promotional materials automatically using autoresponders -- known as drip marketing . They can also segment their promotions to specific market segments . </P> <H2> Legal requirements </H2> <H3> Australia </H3> <P> The Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority , widely known as `` ACMA '' . The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages , states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages , and gives other key information . Fines range with 3 fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) . </P> <H3> Canada </H3> <P> The `` Canada Anti-Spam Law '' ( CASL ) went into effect on July 1 , 2014 . CASL requires an explicit or implicit opt - in from users , and the maximum fines for noncompliance are CA $ 1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses . </P> <H3> European Union </H3> <P> In 2002 the European Union ( EU ) introduced the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications . Article 13 of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses for marketing purposes . The Directive establishes the opt - in regime , where unsolicited emails may be sent only with prior agreement of the recipient ; this does not apply to business email addresses . </P> <P> The directive has since been incorporated into the laws of member states . In the UK it is covered under the Privacy and Electronic Communications ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2003 and applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some form of electronic communication . </P> <H3> United states </H3> <P> The CAN - SPAM Act of 2003 was passed by Congress as a direct response of the growing number of complaints over spam e-mails . Congress determined that the US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation of commercial electronic mail nationally , that those who send commercial e-mails should not mislead recipients over the source or content of them , and that all recipients of such emails have a right to decline them . The act authorizes a US $16,000 penalty per violation for spamming each individual recipient . However , it does not ban spam emailing outright , but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing methods through headings which are `` materially false or misleading '' . In addition there are conditions which email marketers must meet in terms of their format , their content and labeling . As a result , many commercial email marketers within the United States utilize a service or special software to ensure compliance with the act . A variety of older systems exist that do not ensure compliance with the act . To comply with the act 's regulation of commercial email , services also typically require users to authenticate their return address and include a valid physical address , provide a one - click unsubscribe feature , and prohibit importing lists of purchased addresses that may not have given valid permission . </P> <P> In addition to satisfying legal requirements , email service providers ( ESPs ) began to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing campaigns . The service providers supply email templates and general best practices , as well as methods for handling subscriptions and cancellations automatically . Some ESPs will provide insight and assistance with deliverability issues for major email providers . They also provide statistics pertaining to the number of messages received and opened , and whether the recipients clicked on any links within the messages . </P> <P> The CAN - SPAM Act was updated with some new regulations including a no - fee provision for opting out , further definition of `` sender '' , post office or private mail boxes count as a `` valid physical postal address '' and definition of `` person '' . These new provisions went into effect on July 7 , 2008 . </P> <H2> See also </H2> <Ul> <Li> CAUCE -- Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial Email </Li> <Li> Customer engagement </Li> <Li> Suppression list </Li> <Li> Email spam - Unsolicited email marketing </Li> </Ul> <H2> References </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` spam unsolicited e-mail '' .

The show , narrated by Future Ted , tells the story of how Ted Mosby met The Mother . Tracy McConnell appears in 8 episodes from `` Lucky Penny '' to `` The Time Travelers '' as an unseen character ; she was first seen fully in `` Something New '' and was promoted to a main character in season 9 . The Mother is played by Cristin Milioti . </P> <P> The story of how Ted met The Mother is the framing device behind the series ; many facts about her are revealed throughout the series , including the fact that Ted once unwittingly owned her umbrella before accidentally leaving it behind in her apartment . Ted and The Mother meet at the Farhampton train station following Barney Stinson and Robin Scherbatsky 's wedding ; this scene is shown in `` Last Forever '' , the series finale . The Mother 's death from an unspecified terminal illness in 2024 , also revealed in the series finale , received a mixed reaction from fans . </P> <P> An alternate ending was released in the ninth season DVD . In the alternate ending , Tracy Mosby is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030 . In the video , future Ted is heard saying , `` ... When I think how lucky I am to wake up next to your mom every morning , I ca n't help but be amazed how easy it all really was ... '' , indirectly stating that The Mother is alive . The video ends right after the train passes at Farhampton station and credits start rolling , implying that Ted never went back to Robin as he lived a successful married life with Tracy Mosby . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Casting </Li> <Li> 2 Character history <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Name </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Death </Li> <Li> 4 Notes </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Casting ( edit ) </H2> <P> During its first eight seasons , the successful sitcom How I Met Your Mother often hinted at the unseen character of The Mother . Well - known actresses often made guest appearances on the show . Many fans expected that another would play one of the most - wanted roles in Hollywood , but creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas wanted an unknown . Using Anne Hathaway and Amy Adams as examples , Thomas said that `` We did n't want it to be a big famous star because we did n't want the wider audience to have associations with whatever actress this would be ... The whole idea is that Ted 's never seen this woman before , so it better feel that way to the audience '' , similar to how Cobie Smulders being cast as Robin Scherbatsky had `` kept the show alive '' when it began . Bays and Thomas also did not want a large casting call . </P> <P> They chose Cristin Milioti after seeing her on 30 Rock and Once ; her musical ability was also helpful , as The Mother had been described as a band member . After competing for the role against at least two others , Milioti filmed her first scene -- for the last episode of season 8 -- having never watched How I Met Your Mother ; she recalled , `` I had ignorance on my side . So I did n't know what it meant . '' Milioti learned of the character 's importance only after binge watching the show during the summer . </P> <H2> Character history ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Mother was born on September 19 , 1984 . </P> <P> The Mother , joined by her roommate Kelly awaits the arrival of her boyfriend Max only to receive a call informing her of his death . After the funeral service , she returns to the apartment to open Max 's last gift to her -- a ukulele . The Mother spends the next few years grieving the passing of the man she believes was her one true love . </P> <P> In `` Wait for It '' , it is revealed that the short story of how they met involved her yellow umbrella . In `` No Tomorrow '' , Ted finds the umbrella at a club and takes it home after attending a St. Patrick 's Day party which she also attended , as it had been two and a half years since the death of Max , her late boyfriend . She is still grieving , but her roommate Kelly encourages her to go out and date again , bringing her to the same bar where Ted and Barney are celebrating . The two women run into Mitch , her old orchestra instructor ; The Mother offers to give Mitch her cello for his work at a school and they head to her apartment . After they start talking , Mitch encourages her to pursue her dreams . The Mother expresses her desire to end poverty by taking up economics in college . </P> <P> On his first day of teaching as Professor Mosby , as seen in the season 4 finale `` The Leap '' , he is seen in front of the classroom of students , one of which Future Ted says is the titular mother . But in the first episode of season 5 , `` Definitions '' , it is revealed that he was actually in the wrong classroom -- Economics instead of Architecture . At the same time in `` How Your Mother Met Me '' , the Mother sits her first session in Economics 305 and meets another graduate student named Cindy ( Rachel Bilson ) , whom she offers to move in with her as her roommate . They see Ted enter the room , but when he announces the subject , The Mother thinks she is in the wrong room and runs off . She heads back to the room after seeing Ted scramble to his actual classroom . </P> <P> Later , in `` Girls Versus Suits '' , Ted dates Cindy , not knowing that her roommate is his future wife . Throughout the episode , Ted notes that Cindy had spent most of their first date talking jealously about her roommate . When in Cindy and the mother 's apartment he picks up many of The Mother 's belongings , attempting to show how compatible he and Cindy are ( thinking the items are Cindy 's ) and glimpses the mother 's foot as she disappears into her room after taking a shower . Ted finds out at this time that she plays bass guitar in a band . Ted forgets to take the yellow umbrella with him when he goes out and Future Ted mentions , `` this is how your mother got her yellow umbrella back . '' In `` How Your Mother Met Me '' , it is revealed that , after Ted left the apartment , the Mother had discovered the umbrella and , upon going to question Cindy , finds her in a state . As she tried to console her , Cindy said that she was a much better match for Ted , and began to lovingly list all of the reasons that Ted would find the mother attractive , before spontaneously kissing her , revealing that her jealousy towards her roommate was actually a crush . While this incident made Cindy realise that she is a lesbian , it also made the Mother decide to go back into dating , as the kiss was her first in a long time . </P> <P> Some time after this , a man named Darren approaches The Mother and is welcomed into her band named Superfreakonomics . Darren gradually takes over the band . </P> <P> In the season 6 opener `` Big Days '' it is revealed Ted meets his future wife `` the day of '' the wedding at which he is the best man . In the episode `` False Positive '' Robin asks Ted to be her future best man , should she ever get married . In the episode `` Challenge Accepted '' , it is revealed that Ted meets the mother of his children the day of Barney 's wedding . In the last episode of season 7 , `` The Magician 's Code '' it is shown that Barney will marry Robin , and Ted will meet the mother `` the day of '' their wedding . On the premiere of season 8 , Ted 's wife appears after Barney and Robin 's wedding , outside at the `` Farhampton '' station while holding a yellow umbrella and her bass guitar . </P> <P> In the season 8 episode `` Band or DJ ? , '' Ted runs into Cindy on the subway and tells her that the band Barney and Robin hired to play at their wedding cancelled at the last minute . The end result of the encounter is that Cindy 's ( now ex - ) roommate 's band plays at Barney and Robin 's wedding . </P> <P> The Mother is first shown meeting Louis in `` How Your Mother Met Me '' as she is left to carry the band equipment while the now - lead band member Darren talks to his fans . Later at MacLaren 's Pub , she tells him she 's not yet ready to date . Louis asks her to give him a call if she changes her mind and they begin dating not long after . </P> <P> The Mother meets all of Ted 's best friends ( Barney , Lily , Marshall and Robin ) before she meets him . The Mother is responsible for convincing Barney to pursue Robin , as revealed through a flashback in `` Platonish '' . In `` The Locket '' , Tracy meets Lily on a train journey . </P> <P> In `` Bass Player Wanted '' , the Mother picks up a hitchhiking Marshall , carrying his son Marvin , on her way to Farhampton Inn . On their way , it is revealed that the Mother is a bass player in the band , that is scheduled to play at the wedding reception . But the band 's leader , Darren , forced her to quit . The Mother ultimately decides to confront Darren and retake the band . She ends up alone at the bar , and while practicing a speech to give Darren , Darren walks up to her furious the groom 's best man punched him for `` no reason . '' Amused by this , the Mother laughs , and Darren quits the band in anger . </P> <P> In `` How Your Mother Met Me '' , it is shown that after this incident , the Mother returns to Louis ' summer cottage not far from the Farhampton Inn where she has been staying for the duration of the wedding weekend . As she walks in the door , Louis proposes to her , but she goes outside to think about it for a few minutes . She declines Louis ' proposal and leaves his cottage , going to check in at Farhampton Inn . On her room 's balcony , she plays the ukulele and sings `` La Vie en Rose '' . Ted hears her singing from his room next door . </P> <P> In `` Gary Blauman '' , Ted and the Mother are on their first date . Ted picks her up at her New York City apartment and they proceed to walk to a Scottish - Mexican fusion restaurant for dinner . On the way there , Ted is telling her a story when they nearly have a run - in with Louis . She says that she is in the `` weirdest place on earth '' right now and that it is too soon for her to be dating . Ted walks her back to her apartment . They say goodnight and Ted begins to walk away . The Mother then stops him and asks him to finish the story he was telling her . When the story is over , they say goodnight again . The Mother takes a step towards Ted and they kiss for the first time , before deciding to carry on their date . </P> <P> In a flashforward in `` The Lighthouse '' , Ted proposes to the Mother at the top of the lighthouse near Farhampton Inn . She immediately accepts . In another flashfoward in `` Unpause '' , the Mother is revealed to be pregnant with their second child , Luke , in the year 2017 . She goes into labor while she and Ted are staying at Farhampton . </P> <H3> Name ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Mother 's real name is not revealed until the series finale , `` Last Forever '' . When Ted meets her at the Farhampton train station , she reveals that her name is Tracy McConnell . In the season 1 episode `` Belly Full of Turkey '' , Ted meets a stripper named Tracy and says `` ... that , kids , is the true story of how I met your mother '' . The children react in surprise and appear to believe Ted before he admits he is joking , which led some fans to correctly guess that The Mother 's name is Tracy . </P> <H2> Death ( edit ) </H2> See also : Last Forever <P> In the series finale , it is revealed that six years prior to Ted telling the story to his children , Tracy died in 2024 from an undisclosed illness . In the finale the characters do not directly state that the mother is dead . Ted says that she `` became sick '' and his children saying that she has been `` gone '' for six years . Many fans expressed considerable disappointment to The Mother 's death . Milioti cried when she learned her character was supposed to die , but came to accept the ending was what the writers had planned from the beginning . Bill Kuchman from Popculturology said that The Mother was `` an amazing character '' and that `` over the course of this final season HIMYM made us care about Tracy . Kuchman said that `` asking fans to drop all of that with a simple line about The Mother getting sick and passing away was a very difficult request '' , that the finale `` advanced too quickly '' and that `` HIMYM was a victim of its own success on this issue '' . </P> <P> A petition was started , aiming to rewrite and reshoot the finale . The petition has over 20,000 signatures and considerable online news coverage . On April 5 , 2014 , Carter Bays announced on Twitter that an alternate ending would be included on the Season 9 DVD . No new material was shot for this scene . In the alternate ending , the mother is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030 . </P> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ The Mother celebrates her 21st birthday on the day that `` Pilot '' is set .

Note that the picture shows several stages of one and the same spermatozoon - only one penetrates the ovum Illustration depicting ovulation and fertilization . <P> Human fertilization is the union of a human egg and sperm , usually occurring in the ampulla of the fallopian tube . The result of this union is the production of a zygote cell , or fertilized egg , initiating prenatal development . Scientists discovered the dynamics of human fertilization in the nineteenth century . </P> <P> The process of fertilization involves a sperm fusing with an ovum . The most common sequence begins with ejaculation during copulation , follows with ovulation , and finishes with fertilization . Various exceptions to this sequence are possible , including artificial insemination , in vitro fertilization , external ejaculation without copulation , or copulation shortly after ovulation . Upon encountering the secondary oocyte , the acrosome of the sperm produces enzymes which allow it to burrow through the outer jelly coat of the egg . The sperm plasma then fuses with the egg 's plasma membrane , the sperm head disconnects from its flagellum and the egg travels down the Fallopian tube to reach the uterus . </P> <P> In vitro fertilization ( IVF ) is a process by which egg cells are fertilized by sperm outside the womb , in vitro . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Anatomy <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Corona radiata </Li> <Li> 1.2 Cone of attraction and perivitelline membrane </Li> <Li> 1.3 Sperm preparation </Li> <Li> 1.4 Zona pellucida <Ul> <Li> 1.4. 1 Cortical reaction </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Fusion <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Cell membranes </Li> <Li> 2.2 Transformations </Li> <Li> 2.3 Replication </Li> <Li> 2.4 Mitosis </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Fertilization age </Li> <Li> 4 Diseases </Li> <Li> 5 See also </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> <Li> 7 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Anatomy ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Corona radiata ( edit ) </H3> <P> The sperm binds through the corona radiata , a layer of follicle cells on the outside of the secondary oocyte . Fertilization occurs when the nucleus of both a sperm and an egg fuse to form a diploid cell , known as zygote . The successful fusion of gametes forms a new organism . </P> <H3> Cone of attraction and perivitelline membrane ( edit ) </H3> <P> Where the spermatozoon is about to pierce , the yolk ( ooplasm ) is drawn out into a conical elevation , termed the cone of attraction or reception cone . Once the spermatozoon has entered , the peripheral portion of the yolk changes into a membrane , the perivitelline membrane , which prevents the passage of additional spermatozoa . </P> <H3> Sperm preparation ( edit ) </H3> Further information : Acrosome reaction <P> At the beginning of the process , the sperm undergoes a series of changes , as freshly ejaculated sperm is unable or poorly able to fertilize . The sperm must undergo capacitation in the female 's reproductive tract over several hours , which increases its motility and destabilizes its membrane , preparing it for the acrosome reaction , the enzymatic penetration of the egg 's tough membrane , the zona pellucida , which surrounds the oocyte . </P> <H3> Zona pellucida ( edit ) </H3> <P> After binding to the corona radiata the sperm reaches the zona pellucida , which is an extra-cellular matrix of glycoproteins . A special complementary molecule on the surface of the sperm head binds to a ZP3 glycoprotein in the zona pellucida . This binding triggers the acrosome to burst , releasing enzymes that help the sperm get through the zona pellucida . </P> <P> Some sperm cells consume their acrosome prematurely on the surface of the egg cell , facilitating the penetration by other sperm cells . As a population , sperm cells have on average 50 % genome similarity so the premature acrosomal reactions aid fertilization by a member of the same cohort . It may be regarded as a mechanism of kin selection . </P> <P> Recent studies have shown that the egg is not passive during this process . </P> Cortical reaction ( edit ) <P> Once the sperm cells find their way past the zona pellucida , the cortical reaction occurs . Cortical granules inside the secondary oocyte fuse with the plasma membrane of the cell , causing enzymes inside these granules to be expelled by exocytosis to the zona pellucida . This in turn causes the glyco - proteins in the zona pellucida to cross-link with each other -- i.e. the enzymes cause the ZP2 to hydrolyse into ZP2f -- making the whole matrix hard and impermeable to sperm . This prevents fertilization of an egg by more than one sperm . The cortical reaction and acrosome reaction are both essential to ensure that only one sperm will fertilize an egg . </P> <H2> Fusion ( edit ) </H2> Fertilization and implantation in humans . <P> After the sperm enters the cytoplasm of the oocyte ( also called ovocyte ) , the tail and the outer coating of the sperm disintegrate and the cortical reaction takes place , preventing other sperm from fertilizing the same egg . The oocyte now undergoes its second meiotic division producing the haploid ovum and releasing a polar body . The sperm nucleus then fuses with the ovum , enabling fusion of their genetic material . </P> <H3> Cell membranes ( edit ) </H3> <P> The fusion of cell membranes of the secondary oocyte and sperm takes place . </P> <H3> Transformations ( edit ) </H3> <P> In preparation for the fusion of their genetic material both the oocyte and the sperm undergo transformations as a reaction to the fusion of cell membranes . </P> <P> The oocyte completes its second meiotic division . This results in a mature ovum . The nucleus of the oocyte is called a pronucleus in this process , to distinguish it from the nuclei that are the result of fertilization . </P> <P> The sperm 's tail and mitochondria degenerate with the formation of the male pronucleus . This is why all mitochondria in humans are of maternal origin . Still , a considerable amount of RNA from the sperm is delivered to the resulting embryo and likely influences embryo development and the phenotype of the offspring . </P> <H3> Replication ( edit ) </H3> <P> The pronuclei migrate toward the center of the oocyte , rapidly replicating their DNA as they do so to prepare the zygote for its first mitotic division . </P> <H3> Mitosis ( edit ) </H3> <P> Usually 23 chromosomes from spermatozoon and 23 chromosomes from egg cell fuse ( half of spermatozoons carry X chromosome and the other half Y chromosome ) . Their membranes dissolve , leaving no barriers between the male and female chromosomes . During this dissolution , a mitotic spindle forms between them . The spindle captures the chromosomes before they disperse in the egg cytoplasm . Upon subsequently undergoing mitosis ( which includes pulling of chromatids towards centrioles in anaphase ) the cell gathers genetic material from the male and female together . Thus , the first mitosis of the union of sperm and oocyte is the actual fusion of their chromosomes . </P> <P> Each of the two daughter cells resulting from that mitosis has one replica of each chromatid that was replicated in the previous stage . Thus , they are genetically identical . </P> <H2> Fertilization age ( edit ) </H2> <P> Fertilization is the event most commonly used to mark the zero point in descriptions of prenatal development of the embryo or fetus . The resultant age is known as fertilization age , fertilizational age , embryonic age , fetal age or ( intrauterine ) developmental ( IUD ) age . </P> <P> Gestational age , in contrast , takes the beginning of the last menstrual period ( LMP ) as the zero point . By convention , gestational age is calculated by adding 14 days to fertilization age and vice versa . In fact , however , fertilization usually occurs within a day of ovulation , which , in turn , occurs on average 14.6 days after the beginning of the preceding menstruation ( LMP ) . There is also considerable variability in this interval , with a 95 % prediction interval of the ovulation of 9 to 20 days after menstruation even for an average woman who has a mean LMP - to - ovulation time of 14.6 . In a reference group representing all women , the 95 % prediction interval of the LMP - to - ovulation is 8.2 to 20.5 days . </P> <P> The average time to birth has been estimated to be 268 days ( 38 weeks and two days ) from ovulation , with a standard deviation of 10 days or coefficient of variation of 3.7 % . </P> <P> Fertilization age is sometimes used postnatally ( after birth ) as well to estimate various risk factors . For example , it is a better predictor than postnatal age for risk of intraventricular hemorrhage in premature babies treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation . </P> <H2> Diseases ( edit ) </H2> <P> Various disorders can arise from defects in the fertilization process . </P> <Ul> <Li> Polyspermy results from multiple sperm fertilizing an egg . </Li> </Ul> <P> However , some researchers have found that in rare pairs of fraternal twins , their origin might have been from the fertilization of one egg cell from the mother and eight sperm cells from the father . This possibility has been investigated by computer simulations of the fertilization process . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Spontaneous conception , the unassisted conception of a subsequent child after prior use of assisted reproductive technology </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Garrison , Fielding .

It was a late 16th - century attempt by Queen Elizabeth I to establish a permanent English settlement in North America . The colony was founded by Sir Walter Raleigh . </P> <P> The colonists disappeared during the Anglo - Spanish War , three years after the last shipment of supplies from England .

Sir Humphrey Gilbert 's half - brother Sir Walter Raleigh later gained his brother 's charter from the Queen and subsequently executed the details of the charter through his delegates Ralph Lane and Richard Grenville , Raleigh 's distant cousin . </P> <H2> Raleigh 's charter </H2> A watercolor of the fort in Guyanailla Bay , which is likely similar to the fort constructed on Roanoke <P> On March 25 , 1584 , Queen Elizabeth I granted Raleigh a charter for the colonization of the area of North America . This charter specified that Raleigh needed to establish a colony in North America , or lose his right to colonization . </P> <P> The Queen and Raleigh intended that the venture should provide riches from the New World . The queen 's charter said that Raleigh was supposed to `` discover , search , find out , and view such remote heathen and barbarous Lands , Countries , and territories ... to have , hold , occupy , and enjoy '' . </P> <P> The queen 's charter also said that Raleigh was supposed to establish a base from which to send privateers on raids against the treasure fleets of Spain . The purpose of these raids was to tell Spain that England was ready for war . The original charter basically told Raleigh to establish a military base to counteract the activities of the Spaniards . Raleigh himself never visited North America , although he led expeditions in 1595 and 1617 to South America 's Orinoco River basin in search of the legendary golden city of El Dorado . </P> <H2> First Voyages to Roanoke Island </H2> <P> On April 27 , 1584 , Raleigh dispatched an expedition led by Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe to explore the eastern coast of North America . They arrived on Roanoke Island on July 4 and soon established relations with the local natives , the Secotans and Croatans . Barlowe returned to England with two Croatans named Manteo and Wanchese , who were able to describe the politics and geography of the area to Raleigh . Based on the information given , Raleigh organized a second expedition , to be led by Sir Richard Grenville . </P> Sir Walter Raleigh <P> Grenville 's fleet departed Plymouth on April 9 , 1585 , with five main ships : Tiger ( Grenville 's ) , Roebuck , Red Lion , Elizabeth , and Dorothy . A severe storm off the coast of Portugal separated Tiger from the rest of the fleet . The captains had a contingency plan if they were separated , which was to meet up again in Puerto Rico , and Tiger arrived in the `` Baye of Muskito '' ( Guayanilla Bay ) on May 11 . </P> <P> While waiting for the other ships , Grenville established relations with the resident Spanish while simultaneously engaging in some privateering against them . He also built a fort . Elizabeth arrived soon after the fort 's construction . Grenville eventually tired of waiting for the remaining ships and departed on June 7 . The fort was abandoned , and its location remains unknown . </P> <P> Tiger sailed through Ocracoke Inlet on June 26 , but it struck a shoal , ruining most of the food supplies . The expedition succeeded in repairing the ship and , in early July , reunited with Roebuck and Dorothy , which had arrived in the Outer Banks with Red Lion some weeks previous . Red Lion had dropped off its passengers and left for Newfoundland for privateering . </P> <H3> In the New World </H3> <P> During the initial exploration of the mainland coast and the native settlements , the Europeans blamed the natives of the village of Aquascogoc for stealing a silver cup . As retaliation , the settlers sacked and burned the village . English writer and courtier Richard Hakluyt 's contemporaneous reports also describe this incident . ( Hakluyt 's reports of the first voyage to Roanoke were compiled from accounts by various financial backers , including Sir Walter Raleigh . Hakluyt himself never traveled to the New World . ) </P> <P> Despite this incident and a lack of food , Grenville decided to leave Ralph Lane and 107 men to establish a colony at the north end of Roanoke Island , promising to return in April 1586 with more men and fresh supplies . The group disembarked on August 17 , 1585 , and built a small fort on the island . There are no surviving renderings of the Roanoke fort , but it was likely similar in structure to the one in Guayanilla Bay . Grenville in the Tiger on only his seventh day of sail captured ( after a three - day battle ) a rich Spanish galleon , Santa Maria de San Vicente off Bermuda which he took with him as a prize back to England . </P> <P> As April 1586 passed , there was no sign of Grenville 's relief fleet . Meanwhile , in June , bad blood resulted from the destruction of the village , and this spurred an attack on the fort by the local Native Americans , which the colonists were able to repel . Soon after the attack , Sir Francis Drake was on his way home from a successful raid in the Caribbean , and he stopped at the colony and offered to take the colonists back to England . Several accepted , including metallurgist Joachim Gans . On this return voyage , the Roanoke colonists introduced tobacco , maize , and potatoes to England . The relief fleet arrived shortly after Drake 's departure with the colonists . Finding the colony abandoned , Grenville returned to England with the bulk of his force , leaving behind a small detachment of fifteen men both to maintain an English presence and to protect Raleigh 's claim to Roanoke Island . </P> <H2> Lost Colony </H2> <P> In 1587 , Raleigh dispatched a new group of 115 colonists to establish a colony on Chesapeake Bay . They were led by John White , an artist and friend of Raleigh who had accompanied the previous expedition to Roanoke , and was appointed governor of the 1587 colony . White and Raleigh named 12 assistants to aid in the settlement . They were ordered to stop at Roanoke to pick up the small contingent left there by Grenville the previous year , but when they arrived on July 22 , 1587 , they found nothing except a skeleton that may have been the remains of one of the English garrison . </P> Baptism of Virginia Dare , the first English child born in North America . Lithograph , 1880 <P> When they could find no one , the master pilot Simon Fernandez refused to let the colonists return to the ships , insisting that they establish the new colony on Roanoke . His motives remain unclear , however , and new evidence offered by author Brandon Fullam indicates not only that Fernandez had good reason for his actions , but that the decision to alter the Chesapeake Bay destination had already been agreed to prior to their arrival at Roanoke . </P> <P> White re-established relations with the Croatan and other local tribes , but those with whom Lane had fought previously refused to meet with him . Shortly thereafter , colonist George Howe was killed by a native while searching alone for crabs in Albemarle Sound . </P> <P> The colonists persuaded Governor White to return to England to explain the colony 's desperate situation and ask for help . Left behind were about 115 colonists -- the remaining men and women who had made the Atlantic crossing plus White 's newly born granddaughter Virginia Dare , the first English child born in the Americas . </P> <P> White sailed for England in late 1587 , although crossing the Atlantic at that time of year was a considerable risk . Plans for a relief fleet were delayed first by the captain 's refusal to return during the winter , and then the attack on England of the Spanish Armada and the subsequent Anglo - Spanish War . Every able English ship joined the fight , leaving White without a means to return to Roanoke at the time . In the spring of 1588 , White managed to acquire two small vessels and sailed for Roanoke ; however , his attempt to return was thwarted when the captains of the ships attempted to capture several Spanish ships on the outward - bound voyage ( in order to improve their profits ) . They themselves were captured and their cargo seized . With nothing left to deliver to the colonists , the ships returned to England . </P> <H3> Return to the Lost Colony </H3> Further information : Watts ' West Indies and Virginia expedition The discovery of the word `` Croatoan '' carved onto a stockade board <P> Because of the continuing war with Spain , White was unable to mount another resupply attempt for an additional three years . He finally gained passage on a privateering expedition organised by John Watts and Walter Raleigh . They agreed to stop off at Roanoke on the way back after raiding the Spanish in the Caribbean . White landed on August 18 , 1590 , on his granddaughter 's third birthday , but found the settlement deserted . His men could not find any trace of the 90 men , 17 women , and 11 children , nor was there any sign of a struggle or battle . </P> <P> The only clue was the word `` CROATOAN '' carved into a post of the fence around the village , and the letters C-R-O carved into a nearby tree . All the houses and fortifications had been dismantled , which meant that their departure had not been hurried . Before he had left the colony , White instructed the colonists that , if anything happened to them , they should carve a Maltese cross on a tree nearby , indicating that their absence had been forced . There was no cross , and White took this to mean that they had moved to Croatoan Island ( now known as Hatteras Island ) , but he was unable to conduct a search . A massive storm was forming and his men refused to go any farther ; the next day , they left . </P> <H2> Thomas Harriot </H2> <P> Born in 1560 , Thomas Harriot entered Raleigh 's employment in the early 1580s , after graduating from the University of Oxford . Harriot may have been among the men of Arthur Barlowe 's 1584 expedition of the colony . He trained the members of Raleigh 's first Roanoke expedition in navigational skills and eventually sailed to Roanoke with the second group of settlers , where his skills as a naturalist became particularly important along with those of painter and settlement leader John White . </P> <P> Between their arrival in Roanoke in April 1585 and the July 1586 departure , Harriot and White both conducted detailed studies of the Roanoke area , with Harriot compiling his samples and notes into several notebooks that did not survive the colony 's disappearance . Harriot also wrote descriptions of the surrounding flora and fauna of the area , which survive in his work A Brief and True Report of the New Founde Land of Virginia , written as a report on the colony 's progress to the English government on the request of Raleigh . Viewed by modern historians as propaganda for the colony , this work has become vastly important to Roanoke 's history due to Harriot 's observations on wildlife as well as his depictions of Indian activities at the time of the colony 's disappearance . </P> <P> Harriot reports that relations between the Roanoke Indians and the English settlers were mutually calm and prosperous , contradicting other historical evidence that catalogs the bloody struggles between the Roanoke Indians and both of Raleigh 's commanders , Sir Richard Grenville and his successor , Ralph Lane . Harriot recounts little to none of these accounts in his report to England and does not mention the disorderly state of the colony under either Grenville 's or Lane 's tenure , correctly assuming these facts would prevent Roanoke from gaining more settlers . Harriot 's text did not reach England , or the English press , until 1588 , by which time the fate of the `` Lost Colony '' was sealed in all but name . </P> <H2> Investigations into Roanoke </H2> Reconstructed fortifications at Fort Raleigh National Historic Site <P> Twelve years went by before Raleigh decided to find out what happened to his colony . Led by Samuel Mace , this 1602 expedition differed from previous voyages in that Raleigh bought his own ship and guaranteed the sailors ' wages so that they would not be distracted by privateering . However , Raleigh still hoped to make money from the trip , and Mace 's ship landed in the Outer Banks to gather aromatic woods or plants such as sassafras that would generate a decent profit back in England . By the time they could turn their attention to the colonists , the weather had turned bad and they were forced to return without even making it to Roanoke Island . By this time , having been arrested for treason , Raleigh was unable to send any further missions . </P> <P> There was one final expedition in 1603 led by Bartholomew Gilbert with the intention of finding Roanoke colonists . Their intended destination was Chesapeake Bay , but bad weather forced them to land in an unspecified location near there . The landing team , including Gilbert himself , was killed by a group of Native Americans for unknown reasons on July 29 . The remaining crew were forced to return to England empty - handed . </P> <P> Meanwhile , the Spanish had different reasons for wanting to find the colony . Knowing of Raleigh 's plans to use Roanoke as a base for privateering , they were hoping to destroy it . Moreover , they had been getting mostly inaccurate reports of activities there , and they imagined the colony to be far more successful than it actually was . </P> <P> In 1590 , they found the remnants of the colony purely by accident , but assumed it was only an outlying base of the main settlement , which they believed was in the Chesapeake Bay area ( John White 's intended location ) . But just as the Anglo - Spanish War prevented White from returning in a timely manner , Spanish authorities in the New World could not muster enough support back home for such a venture . </P> <H2> Reports of John Smith and William Strachey </H2> <P> Once the Jamestown settlement was established in 1607 , efforts were undertaken by the English to acquire information from the Powhatan tribe about Roanoke . The first definitive information concerning the fate of the Lost Colony came from Captain John Smith , leader of the Jamestown Colony from 1608 to 1609 . According to chronicler Samuel Purchas , Smith learned from Chief Powhatan that he had personally conducted the slaughter of the Roanoke colonists just prior to the arrival of the Jamestown settlers because they were living with the Chesepians , a tribe living in the eastern portion of the present - day South Hampton Roads sub-region who were related to the Pamlico tribe in Carolina and who refused to merge with the Powhatans . This shocking information was reported to England and by the spring of 1609 , King James and the Royal Council were convinced that Chief Powhatan was responsible for the slaughter of the Lost Colony . </P> <P> The second source of Chief Powhatan 's involvement was William Strachey , Secretary of the Jamestown colony in 1610 -- 11 . Strachey 's The Historie of Travaile Into Virginia Britannia seemed to confirm Smith 's report and provided additional information : the colonists had been living peacefully among a group of natives beyond Powhatan 's domain for more than twenty years when they were massacred . Furthermore , Powhatan himself seemed to have directed the slaughter because of prophecies by his priests that he would be overthrown by people from that area , and he reportedly produced several English - made iron implements to back his claim . </P> <P> The information from these two sources , John Smith and William Strachey , provides the basis for the traditional view that the Lost Colony was slaughtered by Chief Powhatan , and versions of the Powhatan - Lost Colony - slaughter scenario have persisted for more than 400 years . However , no bodies were found and no archaeological evidence has been found to support this claim . </P> <P> Furthermore , recent re-examination of the Smith and Strachey sources advanced by author and researcher Brandon Fullam has suggested that the massacre described by Powhatan was actually of the 15 people left behind by the first Roanoke expedition , leaving the fate of the second colony still unknown . </P> <H2> Hypotheses about the disappearance </H2> <P> </P> <H3> Integration with local tribes </H3> The Francis Nelson ( or Zuniga ) map , c. 1607 <P> As per Smith 's and Strachey 's reports , Dr. David Beers Quinn theorized that the colonists moved north to integrate with the Chesepians that Chief Powhatan claimed to have killed . To make the journey northward , Quinn believed that they used the pinnace and other small boats to transport themselves and their belongings . Naturally , if that were the mode of transportation , the colonists could have gone to live in other locations as well . </P> <P> In her 2000 book Roanoke : Solving the Mystery of the Lost Colony , historian Lee Miller postulated that some of the Lost Colony survivors sought shelter with the Chowanoke , who were attacked by another tribe , identified by the Jamestown Colony as the `` Mandoag '' ( an Algonquian name commonly given to enemy nations ) . The Mandoag are believed to be either the Tuscarora , an Iroquois - speaking tribe , or the Eno , also known as the Wainoke . </P> <P> The so - called `` Zuniga Map '' ( named for Pedro de Z\\u00fa\\u00f1iga , the Spanish ambassador to England , who had secured a copy and passed it on to Philip III of Spain ) , drawn about 1607 by the Jamestown settler Francis Nelson , also gives credence to this claim . The map states `` four men clothed that came from roonock '' were living in an Iroquois site on the Neuse . William Strachey wrote that , at the Indian settlements of Peccarecanick and Ochanahoen , there were reportedly two - story houses with stone walls . The Indians supposedly had learned how to build them from the Roanoke settlers . In both cases , as stated above , it is equally possible that these were survivors of Chief Powhatan 's attack on the first Jamestown colonists . </P> <P> There were also reported sightings of European captives at various Indian settlements during the same time period . Strachey wrote in 1612 that four English men , two boys and one girl had been sighted at the Eno settlement of Ritanoc , under the protection of a chief called Eyanoco . Strachey reported that the captives were forced to beat copper and that they had escaped the attack on the other colonists and fled up the Chaonoke river , the present - day Chowan River in Bertie County , North Carolina . </P> <P> John Lawson wrote in his 1709 work A New Voyage to Carolina that the Croatans living on Hatteras Island used to live on Roanoke Island and claimed to have white ancestors : </P> <P> A farther Confirmation of this we have from the Hatteras Indians , who either then lived on Ronoak - Island , or much frequented it . These tell us , that several of their Ancestors were white People , and could talk in a Book , as we do ; the Truth of which is confirm 'd by gray Eyes being found frequently amongst these Indians , and no others . They value themselves extremely for their Affinity to the English , and are ready to do them all friendly Offices . It is probable , that this Settlement miscarry 'd for want of timely Supplies from England ; or thro ' the Treachery of the Natives , for we may reasonably suppose that the English were forced to cohabit with them , for Relief and Conversation ; and that in process of Time , they conform 'd themselves to the Manners of their Indian Relations . </P> <P> From the early 17th century to the middle 18th century , European colonists reported encounters with gray - eyed American Indians who claimed descent from the colonists ( although at least one , a story of a Welsh priest who met a Doeg warrior who spoke the Welsh language , is likely to be a hoax ) . Records from French Huguenots who settled along the Tar River in 1696 tell of meeting Tuscaroras with blond hair and blue eyes not long after their arrival . As Jamestown was the nearest English settlement , and they had no record of being attacked by Tuscarora , the likelihood that the origin of those fair - skinned natives was the Lost Colony is high . </P> <P> Fred Willard and Phillip MacMullan believe that the colonists along with the Croatans relocated to villages along the Alligator River in an area known as `` Beechland '' , slightly inland from Roanoke Island . Archeological remains of settlements have been discovered in the area , including coffins with Christian markings on them where there had been no previous record of a grave site , but their hypothesis is mostly based on oral histories and also lacks any definitive evidence . </P> <P> In the late 1880s , North Carolina state legislator Hamilton McMillan discovered that his `` redbones '' ( those of Indian blood ) neighbors in Robeson County claimed to have been descended from the Roanoke settlers . He also noticed that many of the words in their language had striking similarities to obsolete English words . Furthermore , many of the family names were identical to those listed in Hakluyt 's account of the colony . Thus on February 10 , 1885 , convinced that these were the descendants of the Lost Colony , he helped to pass the `` Croatan bill '' , that officially designated the population around Robeson county as Croatan . Two days later on February 12 , 1885 , the Fayetteville Observer published an article regarding the Robeson people 's origins . This article states : </P> <P> They say that their traditions say that the people we call the Croatan Indians ( though they do not recognize that name as that of a tribe , but only a village , and that they were Tuscaroras ) , were always friendly to the whites ; and finding them destitute and despairing of ever receiving aid from England , persuaded them to leave ( Roanoke Island ) , and go to the mainland ... They gradually drifted away from their original seats , and at length settled in Robeson , about the center of the county ... </P> <P> However , the case was far from settled . A similar legend claims that the now extinct Saponi of Person County , North Carolina , are descended from the English colonists of Roanoke Island . However , no documented evidence exists to link the Saponi to the Roanoke colonists . </P> <P> Other tribes claiming partial descent from surviving Roanoke colonists include the Catawba ( who absorbed the Shakori and Eno people ) , and the Coree and the people who call themselves the Lumbee . Samuel A'Court Ashe was convinced that the colonists had relocated westward to the banks of the Chowan River in Bertie County , and Conway Whittle Sams claimed that after being attacked by Wanchese and Powhatan , the colonists scattered to multiple locations : the Chowan River , and south to the Pamlico and Neuse Rivers . </P> <H3> Other theories </H3> Spanish <P> Another theory is that the Spanish destroyed the colony . Earlier in the century , the Spanish did destroy evidence of the French colony of Fort Charles in coastal South Carolina and then massacred the inhabitants of Fort Caroline , a French colony near present - day Jacksonville , Florida . However , a Spanish attack is unlikely , as the Spanish were still looking for the location of England 's failed colony as late as 1600 , ten years after White discovered that the colony was missing . </P> Dare stones Main article : Dare Stones <P> From 1937 to 1941 , a series of inscribed stones were discovered that were claimed to have been written by Eleanor Dare , mother of Virginia Dare . They told of the travelings of the colonists and their ultimate deaths . Most historians believe that they are a fraud , but there are some today who still believe at least one of the stones to be genuine . </P> Virginia Pars map <P> In May 2011 , Brent Lane of the First Colony Foundation was studying the Virginia Pars Map , which was made by John White during his 1585 visit to Roanoke Island , and noticed two patches where the map had been corrected . The patches are made of paper contemporaneous with that of the map . Lane asked researchers at the British Museum in London , where the map has been kept since 1866 , what might be under the patches , sparking a research investigation . On May 3 , 2012 , at Wilson Library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , members of the Foundation and representatives of the museum announced the discovery of `` a large , square - shaped symbol with oddly shaped corners . '' This symbol , presumed to represent a fort , is visible when the map is viewed on a light box . Some scholars speculate that the colonists relocated to that location , on what is now called Salmon Creek in the Bertie County community of Merry Hill . The Scotch Hall Preserve golf course community was planned on the site , but it has not been fully developed . </P> <P> The discovery of new information on the map led to more study of artifacts previously found , as well as additional digs in 2012 and 2014 . </P> <H2> Archaeological evidence </H2> <P> In 1993 , Hurricane Emily caused numerous relics to appear , and David Phelps of East Carolina University later began digging in the area and found evidence the settlers lived with the native people . </P> <P> In 1998 , East Carolina University organized `` The Croatoan Project '' , an archaeological investigation into the events at Roanoke . The excavation team sent to Hatteras Island uncovered what they believed to be a 10 karat ( 42 % ) gold 16th - century English signet ring , gun flints , and two copper farthings ( produced sometime in the 1670s ) at the site of the ancient Croatan capital , 50 miles ( 80 km ) from the old Roanoke Colony . Genealogists were able to trace the lion crest on the signet ring to the Kendall coat of arms , and concluded that the ring most likely belonged to one Master Kendall who is recorded as having lived in the Roanoke Colony from 1585 to 1586 . If this is the case , the ring represents the first material connection between the Roanoke colonists and the Native Americans on Hatteras Island . However , archaeologist David Phelps did not have the ring tested , and Charles Ewen , who continued Phelps ' work after Phelps retired , had the ring tested and found the ring was brass . Ewen announced his findings in April 2017 . Mark Horton of the University of Bristol said he was not convinced that this news proved the ring did not date to the 16th century . </P> <P> It is also believed that the reason for the extreme deficiency in archaeological evidence is due to shoreline erosion . Since all that was found was a rustic looking fort on the north shore , and this location is well - documented and backed up , it is believed that the settlement must have been nearby . The northern shore , between 1851 and 1970 , lost 928 feet ( 283 m ) because of erosion . If in the years leading up to and following the brief life of the settlement at Roanoke , shoreline erosion was following the same trend , it is likely the site of the dwellings is underwater , along with any artifacts or signs of life . Archaeological investigations continue to find tantalizing clues and funding is being sought to continue recent excavations . </P> <H2> Climate factors </H2> <P> In 1998 , a team led by climatologist David W. Stahle , of the University of Arkansas and archaeologist Dennis B. Blanton of the College of William and Mary used tree ring cores from 800 - year - old bald cypresses taken from the Roanoke Island area of North Carolina and the Jamestown area of Virginia to reconstruct precipitation and temperature chronologies . </P> <P> The researchers concluded that the settlers of the Lost Colony landed at Roanoke Island in the summer of the worst growing - season drought in 800 years . `` This drought persisted for 3 years , from 1587 to 1589 , and is the driest 3 - year episode in the entire 800 - year reconstruction , '' the team reported in the journal Science . A map shows that `` the Lost Colony drought affected the entire southeastern United States but was particularly severe in the Tidewater region near Roanoke ( Island ) . '' The authors suggested that the Croatan who were shot and killed by the colonists may have been scavenging the abandoned village for food as a result of the drought . </P> <H2> Lost Colony of Roanoke DNA Project </H2> <P> The Lost Colony of Roanoke DNA Project was founded in 2007 by a group led by Roberta Estes , who owns a private DNA - testing company , in order to solve the mystery of the Lost Colony using historical records , migration patterns , oral histories and DNA testing . The project used Y chromosome , Mitochondrial DNA and Autosomal DNA .

French has also kept a strong role in the Maghreb countries , though this has receded somewhat with official Arabization . </Li> <Li> Francophone Africa is a continuous area in West Africa and Central Africa , plus Madagascar and Djibouti . </Li> <Li> Lusophone Africa consists of the widely separated countries of Cabo Verde , Guinea - Bissau , Sao Tome and Principe , Angola , and Mozambique . </Li> <Li> Equatorial Guinea is the only African country where the Spanish language is official , though French and more recently Portuguese have also been added as official languages . </Li> <Li> Swahili is widely used as an inter language in East Africa ; its use for official and educational functions is greatest in Tanzania . </Li> <Li> Ethiopia and Somalia use the Afro - Asiatic Amharic and Somali languages , respectively , as their official languages , although Arabic also serves as a secondary language in Somalia .

Source : RisCura <P> A slightly less common , but equally important method of division of the continent is by investment factors . For the purposes of investing , Africa is not a single destination with a single set of standardized risk factors and homogeneous potential for reward . Although some high - level similarities are evident , digging into the specifics of certain regions and countries shows that Africa comprises a range of distinct investment destinations , each with its own attractions , flaws , cultural differences and business practices . </P> <P> The investment approach was first developed by global , independent financial analytics provider and investment consultant , RisCura . </P> <Ul> <Li> Maghreb region <Dl> <Dd> Otherwise known as the western portion of Northern Africa , these countries form the Arab Maghreb Union , established in 1989 . The region was established with the goal of functioning as a unified political and economic grouping . Political unrest in the region has stunted progress since its inception but hope still remains that the Union will fulfill its purpose in years to come . Algeria , Libya , Mauritania , Morocco and Tunisia are included in this region . </Dd> </Dl> </Li> <Li> Egypt and Sudan <Dl> <Dd> Previously united under British rule , these countries still share strong ties , as well as one significant commonality -- the trade facilitation through transport on the Nile River . As Egypt does not fall within the Arab Maghreb Union , it is separated from the rest of North Africa . However , Egypt 's strong economic and cultural ties with the Middle East bring natural trading partners , and it is often seen grouped with the Middle East for investment purposes . </Dd> </Dl> </Li> <Li> Francophone West Africa <Dl> <Dd> This is a commonly recognized region on the continent , and typically includes Mauritania . However , Mauritania is sometimes allocated to the Maghreb region as it is found to have closer ties to the North African countries . These French - speaking countries share more than just a language . Due to their common history as French colonies , they also share similar legal and socio - political systems . The countries in this group are Benin , Burkina Faso , Cape Verde , C\\u00f4te d'Ivoire , Guinea , Mali , Niger , S\\u00e3o Tom\\u00e9 and Pr\\u00edncipe , Senegal and Togo . </Dd> </Dl> </Li> <Li> Nigeria <Dl> <Dd> On its own , Nigeria is the size of the entire Maghreb region on an aggregated - GDP basis . While Nigeria is traditionally grouped with the rest of West Africa , its reliance on the rest of the region is less pronounced , likely as a result of its massive standalone GDP , its access to international markets via its six large ports , and its population of over 170 million people . </Dd> </Dl> </Li> <Li> East Africa <Dl> <Dd> This is a combination of the East African Community ( Kenya , Tanzania , Uganda , Rwanda and Burundi ) , the LAPSSET corridor ( Kenya , South Sudan and Ethiopia ) as well as Djibouti , a crucial link to the Indian Ocean for Ethiopia and South Sudan . Kenya has traditionally headlined this region through consistently generating the largest GDP and acts as the primary route to international trade through the Mombasa port . </Dd> </Dl> </Li> <Li> Central Africa <Dl> <Dd> This market is the same as that defined by the African Development Bank with the exception of Madagascar , which here is classified as Southern Africa ( ex-SA ) . On a GDP basis ( USD ) and by population , the Central Africa region is on par with the Francophone West African region . Countries included here are Cameroon , Central African Republic , Chad and the Democratic Republic of Congo , as well as Equatorial Guinea and Gabon . </Dd> </Dl> </Li> <Li> Southern Africa excluding South Africa ( ex-SA ) <Dl> <Dd> This incorporates countries south of central and eastern Africa , and north of the South African border . The region has support from the most developed economy on the continent from the south , and access to capital coming out of South Africa as large companies look to expand into the rest of the continent . The group comprises Angola ( which offers substantial oil resources ) , Botswana , Comoros , Madagascar , Malawi , Mauritius , Mozambique , Namibia , Reunion , Zambia ( substantial supply of copper ) and Zimbabwe . </Dd> </Dl> </Li> <Li> South Africa <Dl> <Dd> Like Nigeria , South Africa is a large African economy on a standalone basis . Due to the developed nature of South Africa relative to the rest of the continent , it has not been included in the Southern African region . South Africa boasts the largest GDP per capita of all the regions ( double that of Nigeria ) and is the most advanced investment destination on the continent . The South African market includes Lesotho and Swaziland due to their reliance and proximity to SA . The Swazi lilangeni is pegged to the South African rand , which is also accepted as currency within the country . </Dd> </Dl> </Li> <Li> Other West Africa <Dl> <Dd> This region includes Ghana , Liberia , Sierra Leone , Guinea - Bissau and The Gambia . </Dd> </Dl> </Li> </Ul> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Regions of the African Union </Li> <Li> United Nations geoscheme for Africa </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Africa portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Africa </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Overview of Module Twenty : Southern Africa '' .

She plays the role of Mantis in the film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 ( 2017 ) and will appear in the same role in the film Avengers : Infinity War ( 2018 ) . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Early life </Li> <Li> 2 Career </Li> <Li> 3 Filmography </Li> <Li> 4 See also </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Early life ( edit ) </H2> <P> Pom Klementieff was born in Quebec City , Quebec , Canada , to a Korean mother and French - Russian father , who was working there as a consul with the French government . She had a brother who committed suicide . Her parents chose the name `` Pom '' because it is similar in pronunciation to the Korean words for both `` spring '' ( \\ubd04 ) and `` tiger '' ( \\ubc94 ) . Klementieff lived in Canada for one year before her family traveled extensively due to her father 's job , and she lived in Japan and the Ivory Coast before settling in France . Klementieff later said that travelling at an early age gave her a `` gypsy soul '' . </P> <P> Klementieff 's father died of cancer when she was 5 , and her mother was schizophrenic and unable to care for children , so Klementieff was raised by her paternal uncle and aunt . Her uncle , whom she described as `` like my second father '' , died on her 18th birthday . Klementieff briefly attended law school after her uncle 's death to appease her aunt , but did not find the career path appealing . She also worked as a waitress and saleswoman in France . She started acting at age 19 at the Cours Florent drama school in Paris . A few months into her education , she won a theater competition that awarded her free classes for two years with the school 's top teachers . </P> <H2> Career ( edit ) </H2> Klementieff in 2018 <P> Klementieff 's first professional acting job was the French independent film Apr\\u00e8s lui ( 2007 ) , portraying the stepdaughter of the protagonist played by Catherine Deneuve . Filming for her scenes took three days . During one scene , Klementieff was supposed to push someone down a set of stairs but accidentally fell down the stairs herself , and director Ga\\u00ebl Morel kept that shot in the final film . Her first leading role was in Loup ( 2009 ) , a French film about a tribe of reindeer herders in the Siberian mountains . During filming , Klementieff stayed in a camp , hours from the nearest village , where temperatures dropped well below zero . During filming she befriended nomads who lived there , worked with real wolves , rode reindeer , and swam with a horse in a lake . </P> <P> Klementieff made her Hollywood debut in Spike Lee 's Oldboy ( 2013 ) , a remake of the South Korean film of the same name . She portrayed Haeng - Bok , the bodyguard of the antagonist played by Sharlto Copley . A fan of the original film , Klementieff heard about the part through Roy Lee , a producer with the remake , and took boxing lessons after learning the role involved martial arts . After showcasing her boxing skills during her audition , Lee asked her to go home and come back wearing a more feminine outfit and make - up , like her character in the film . She contributed some of her own clothes to the character 's wardrobe , and trained three hours a day for two months for an on - screen fight with star Josh Brolin . Klementieff came up with the name Haeng - Bok , Korean for `` happiness '' , herself after Lee asked her to research possible names for the character . </P> <P> Klementieff moved to Los Angeles after Oldboy was filmed and began pursuing more Hollywood auditions . She continued taekwondo after the film , and has a purple belt as of the summer of 2014 . Her next acting role was the film Hacker 's Game ( 2015 ) , in which she plays a hacker she compared to Lisbeth Salander from the novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo . Klementieff used her boxing skills again in the film , and due to the movie 's low budget , she had to do her own make - up and chose her own wardrobe . It was her idea to dye her hair purple for the role , to which the directors first objected but later acquiesced . She joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe with her role as Mantis in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 ( 2017 ) and will appear in the same role in the film Avengers : Infinity War ( 2018 ) . </P> <H2> Filmography ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Year </Th> <Th> Title </Th> <Th> Role </Th> <Th> Notes </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2007 </Td> <Td> Apr\\u00e8s lui </Td> <Td> Emilie </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2008 </Td> <Td> The Easy Way </Td> <Td> NHI </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2009 </Td> <Td> Loup </Td> <Td> Nastazya </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2009 </Td> <Td> Pigalle , la nuit </Td> <Td> Sandra </Td> <Td> TV series ( eight episodes ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2011 </Td> <Td> Borderline </Td> <Td> Naomi </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2011 </Td> <Td> Sleepless Night </Td> <Td> Lucy </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2011 </Td> <Td> Delicacy </Td> <Td> Waitress </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2011 </Td> <Td> Love Lasts Three Years </Td> <Td> Julia </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2011 </Td> <Td> Silhouettes </Td> <Td> Valerie </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2012 </Td> <Td> Radiostars </Td> <Td> The pizza girl </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2012 </Td> <Td> Porn in the Hood </Td> <Td> Tia </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2012 </Td> <Td> \\u00c0 l'ombre du palmier </Td> <Td> Le mod\\u00e8le </Td> <Td> Short film </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2012 </Td> <Td> El Turrrf </Td> <Td> Pom </Td> <Td> Short film </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2013 </Td> <Td> Paris \\u00e0 tout prix </Td> <Td> Jess </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2013 </Td> <Td> Oldboy </Td> <Td> Haeng - Bok </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2014 </Td> <Td> RossFit </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> Short film </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2015 </Td> <Td> Hacker 's Game </Td> <Td> Loise </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2016 </Td> <Td> Seed </Td> <Td> Cat </Td> <Td> Short film </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2017 </Td> <Td> Ingrid Goes West </Td> <Td> Harley Chung </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2017 </Td> <Td> Newness </Td> <Td> Bethany </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2017 </Td> <Td> Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 </Td> <Td> Mantis </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2017 </Td> <Td> Alteration </Td> <Td> Elsa </Td> <Td> Short film </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2018 </Td> <Td> Avengers : Infinity War </Td> <Td> Mantis </Td> <Td> Post-production </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2019 </Td> <Td> Untitled Avengers film </Td> <Td> Post-production </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Biography portal </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Qui es - tu Pom Klementieff ? / Who are you Pom Klementieff ?

After several suggestions of what to call their snowman ( including `` Oatmeal '' and `` Christopher Columbus '' ) , Karen decides to name him `` Frosty . '' Later , the children acquire a top hat discarded by inept magician Professor Hinkle . Karen places the hat on top of Frosty 's head , and the snowman comes to life ( and always says `` Happy Birthday ! '' in response ) . When Hinkle learns of the magic power his hat actually possesses , he takes it back and departs , pretending that he did not see Frosty come to life . However , the professor 's pet rabbit , Hocus Pocus , returns the hat to Frosty and the children . </P> <P> Frosty soon senses the temperature is rising and worries about melting away . The children suggest putting him on the next train to the North Pole , where he will never melt , and they all parade into the city on the way to the train station , where Frosty has his confrontation with the traffic cop mentioned in the song 's lyrics . When Karen explains that Frosty came to life and does n't know what a traffic light or a lamp post is , the traffic cop lets Frosty go . At the train station , Frosty stows away aboard a refrigerated train car , since neither he nor the children have any money for a train ticket . As the train is about to leave the station , Karen and Hocus decide to join Frosty for the ride to keep him company . With that , Frosty , Karen , and Hocus wave goodbye to the other kids as the train takes off . Unbeknownst to them , Hinkle has also hitched a ride on the train , intending to get his hat back . </P> <P> As the train continues up north , however , Frosty notices Karen is freezing and starting to catch a cold , so they jump off the train , leaving Hinkle behind once again . Hinkle , seeing them escape , jumps off the train too , but falls down a mountain and crashes into a tree where a pile of snow falls on him . At Frosty 's request , Hocus convinces some forest animals who are preparing for Christmas to build a campfire for Karen . Fearing that Karen still can not survive for long in the cold weather , Frosty asks Hocus who might be able to help them . Hocus suggests ( by pantomiming ) the President of the United States and the United States Marines , before suggesting Santa Claus . Frosty agrees , and promptly takes credit for the idea himself ( much to Hocus ' annoyance ) . Hocus hops off to get Santa , but Hinkle then confronts Frosty and Karen once more and blows out Karen 's campfire . Frosty and Karen are again forced to flee , this time with Karen riding on Frosty 's back as he slides head - first down a hill . At the bottom of the slope , Karen and Frosty discover a greenhouse filled with Christmas poinsettias . Despite Karen 's objections , Frosty steps inside the warm greenhouse with her , suggesting that he could afford to lose a little weight while she warms up . Unfortunately , an angry and vengeful Hinkle catches up to them immediately after and locks them in the greenhouse . </P> <P> Hocus brings Santa Claus to the greenhouse only to find Karen in tears and Frosty melted on the floor due to Hinkle 's cruel act . Santa explains to Karen that Frosty is made from Christmas snow , and that he can never completely disappear , only take the form of summer rain , until next December . With a gust of cold wind through the open greenhouse door , the puddle that was Frosty blows out the door and magically changes back into his typical snowman form . Before Santa can put the finishing touch on Frosty and bring him back to life , as Hocus arrives with the hat , Hinkle arrives on the scene and again demands the return of his hat . He relents only when threatened with being removed from Santa 's Christmas list for the rest of his life if he put so much as one finger on the hat . Santa states that if Hinkle is truly repentant for his mean attitude and harming Frosty , and if he goes home and writes `` I am really sorry for what I did to Frosty '' a hundred zillion times , he may find a gift in his stocking on Christmas morning , which makes Hinkle bid Frosty and Karen farewell and run home to repeatedly write his apologies , assuming he may get a new hat . Finally , Santa then places the magic hat back on top of Frosty 's head , and the snowman returns to life again . After celebrating , Santa takes Karen home and Frosty to the North Pole , but promises that Frosty will be back next winter . </P> <P> The end credits show all the characters the next Christmas marching through the town square with Frosty in the lead , singing the `` Frosty the Snowman '' song . Among them is a redeemed Professor Hinkle , who is proudly wearing his new top hat . At the end of the parade , Frosty gets back into Santa 's waiting sleigh and they return to the North Pole , with Frosty proclaiming , `` I 'll be back on Christmas Day !

Jackie Vernon once again reprised his role as the voice of Frosty . Animation is produced by Topcraft in Japan . Unlike the original , the sequel takes place later in the winter season and is based upon the 1934 song `` Winter Wonderland ; '' it features Frosty 's pursuit of a wife and efforts to preserve him into the springtime . Furthermore , it makes no mention whatsoever of Christmas ; in fact it could be considered more a `` winter solstice '' special than a Christmas special as it celebrates the season of winter . </Li> <Li> Rudolph and Frosty 's Christmas in July -- This 1979 Rankin / Bass feature - length sequel was filmed in `` Animagic '' stop - motion animation in the style of Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer and Rudolph 's Shiny New Year . While the Frosty specials were 30 minutes long , and the Rudolph specials were 60 minutes , this ambitious special was feature length , at 97 minutes long ( 120 minutes on television , including commercials ) . Vernon once again played the role of Frosty , in his last time for Rankin / Bass playing the voice of Frosty . This film features Frosty and his family as supporting characters . This is the only other Frosty cartoon to mention Christmas or Santa Claus in addition to the 1969 original . </Li> <Li> Frosty Returns -- This 1992 half - hour special is not truly a sequel to the 1969 classic , as it was produced not by Rankin / Bass but by CBS . The characters , setting , voices and animation ( by Bill Melendez ) are vastly different . Despite this , it is shown with the original special every year on CBS and was even included as a bonus on its DVD release . John Goodman provides the voice of Frosty in this special , and Jonathan Winters serves as narrator . Frosty 's appearance is physically different , his personality and humor have changed , and he has the ability to live without his top hat , in direct contrast with the original and its other sequels . Also in contrast to the original specials , the special avoids all mention of Christmas ( despite the special portraying the beginning of winter ) and has an environmentalist theme , as Frosty works to stop a corporate executive whose product wipes out snow packs with one spray . </Li> <Li> The Legend of Frosty the Snowman -- This 2005 straight - to - video film was produced by Classic Media , the previous rights holder for the original Rankin / Bass special , and the remainder of their pre-1974 library . This movie has been bundled with the original 1969 Rankin / Bass special and the CBS sequel , and has also aired on Cartoon Network . The appearance of Frosty resembles much more the Rankin / Bass character design from their original animation , and Professor Hinkle returns in two cameo appearances -- shown in a picture and flashback . Frosty is voiced by Bill Fagerbakke , best known as the voice of Patrick Star on SpongeBob SquarePants . And it , like Frosty Returns and Frosty 's Winter Wonderland , also never mentions anything to do with Christmas whatsoever . </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ TV Guide Guide to TV .

            "{\"document_text\": \"History of the Acadians - wikipedia <H1> History of the Acadians </H1> Not to be confused with History of Acadia . Acadian flag <P> The Acadians ( French : Acadiens ) are the descendants of the French settlers , and sometimes the Indigenous peoples , of parts of Acadia ( French : Acadie ) in the northeastern region of North America comprising what is now the Canadian Maritime Provinces of New Brunswick , Nova Scotia , and Prince Edward Island , Gasp\\u00e9 , in Quebec , and to the Kennebec River in southern Maine . </P> <P> The history of the Acadians was significantly influenced by the six colonial wars that took place in Acadia during the 17th and 18th century ( see the four French and Indian Wars , Father Rale 's War and Father Le Loutre 's War ) . Eventually , the last of the colonial wars -- the French and Indian War -- resulted in the British Expulsion of the Acadians from the region . After the war , many Acadians came out of hiding or returned to Acadia from the British Colonies . Others remained in France and some migrated from there to Louisiana , where they became known as Cajuns , a corruption of the word Acadiens or Acadians . The nineteenth century saw the beginning of the Acadian Renaissance and the publication of Evangeline , which helped galvanize Acadian identity . In the last century Acadians have made achievements in the areas of equal language and cultural rights as a minority group in the Maritime provinces of Canada . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 As French colonials <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Port Royal Habitation ( 1604 - 1613 ) </Li> <Li> 1.2 Arrival of the first European families </Li> <Li> 1.3 Civil war </Li> <Li> 1.4 English colony ( 1654 -- 1667 ) </Li> <Li> 1.5 Post Treaty of Breda </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Colonial Wars <Ul> <Li> 2.1 French and Indian War <Ul> <Li> 2.1. 1 Acadian and Mi'kmaq resistance </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2.2 Re-establishing in Nova Scotia </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Nineteenth century <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Acadian renaissance </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Twentieth century <Ul> <Li> 4.1 The Quiet Revolution </Li> <Li> 4.2 Antonine Maillet </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Twenty - first century <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Acadian Remembrance Day </Li> <Li> 5.2 Acadian World Congress </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Notes </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> <Li> 10 Further reading </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> As French colonials ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Port Royal Habitation ( 1604 - 1613 ) ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Habitation at Port - Royal Portrait of Captain Samuel Argall <P> Pierre Dugua , Sieur de Monts built the Habitation at Port - Royal in 1605 as a replacement for his initial attempt at colonizing Saint Croix Island ( present day Maine ) . The trading monopoly of de Monts was cancelled in 1607 , and most of the French settlers returned to France , although some remained with the natives . Jean de Biencourt de Poutrincourt et de Saint - Just led a second expedition to Port Royal in 1610 . </P> <H3> Arrival of the first European families ( edit ) </H3> <P> The survival of the Acadian settlements was based on successful cooperation with the Indigenous peoples of the region . In the early years of Acadian settlement , this included a small number of recorded marriages between Acadian settlers and Indigenous women . Some records have survived showing marriages between Acadian settlers and Indigenous women in formal Roman Catholic rites , for example , the marriage of Charles La Tour to a Mi'kmaw woman in 1626 . There were also reported instances of Acadian settlers marrying Indigenous spouses according to Mi'kmaq rites , and subsequently living in Mi'kmaq communities . Many settlers also brought French wives with them to Acadia , such as La Tour 's second wife , Fran\\u00e7oise - Marie Jacquelin , who joined him in Acadia in 1640 . </P> <P> Governor Isaac de Razilly 's administration at LaHave , Nova Scotia , prepared the ground for the arrival of the first recorded migrant families on board the Saint Jehan , which left La Rochelle on 1 April 1636 . There were a number of sailings from the French Atlantic Coast to Acadia between 1632 and 1636 , but this is the only one for which a detailed passenger list has survived . Nicolas Denys , who was stationed across the LaHave River at Port Rossingol ( Liverpool Bay ) , acted as agent for the Saint Jehan . After a 35 - day crossing of the Atlantic , the Saint Jehan arrived on 6 May 1636 at LaHave , Nova Scotia . There were seventy - eight passengers and eighteen crew members . With this ship , Acadia began a slow shift from being primarily a matter of explorers and traders , of men , to a colony of permanent settlers , including women and children . While the presence of European women is a signal that settlement was seriously contemplated , there were yet so few of them in this group of migrants that they did not immediately affect the status of Acadia as basically a colony of European transients . By the end of the year , the migrants were moved from LaHave and re-established at Port Royal . At Port Royal in 1636 , Pierre Martin and Catherine Vigneau , who had arrived on the Saint Jehan , were the first European parents to have a child in Acadia . The first - born child was Mathieu Martin . In part because of this distinction , Mathieu Martin later became the Seigneury of Cobequid ( 1699 ) . </P> <P> Kennedy ( 2014 ) argues that the emigrants from the Vienne region of France carried to Acadia their customs and social structure . They were frontier people , who dispersed their settlements based on kinship . They optimized use of farmland and emphasized trading for a profit . They were hierarchical and politically active . The French and the Acadian villages were similar in terms of prosperity , egalitarianism , and independent - mindedness . Kennedy says the emergence of a distinct Acadian identity emerged from the gradual adaptation of traditional French methods , institutions , and ideas to the North American environmental and political situations . </P> <H3> Civil War ( edit ) </H3> Siege of St. John ( 1645 ) - d'Aulnay defeats La Tour in Acadia Main article : Acadian Civil War <P> With the death of Isaac de Razilly , Acadia was plunged into what some historians have described as a civil war ( 1640 -- 1645 ) . Acadia had two legitimate Lieutenant Governors . The war was between Port Royal , where Governor Charles de Menou d'Aulnay de Charnisay was stationed , and present - day Saint John , New Brunswick , where Governor Charles de Saint - \\u00c9tienne de la Tour was stationed . </P> <P> In the war , there were four major battles . La Tour attacked d'Aulnay at Port Royal in 1640 . In response to the attack , D'Aulnay sailed out of Port Royal to establish a five - month blockade of La Tour 's fort at Saint John , which La Tour eventually defeated ( 1643 ) . La Tour attacked d'Aulnay again at Port Royal in 1643 . D'Aulnay and Port Royal ultimately won the war against La Tour with the 1645 siege of Saint John . After d'Aulnay died ( 1650 ) , La Tour re-established himself in Acadia . </P> <H3> English colony ( 1654 -- 1667 ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1654 , war between France and England broke out . Led by Major Robert Sedgwick , a flotilla from Boston , under orders from Cromwell , arrived in Acadia to chase the French out . The flotilla seized La Tour 's fort , then Port - Royal . La Tour , nevertheless , managed to find himself in England , where , with the support of John Kirke , succeeded in receiving from Cromwell a part of Acadia , along with Sir Thomas Temple . La Tour returned to Cap - de-Sable where he remained until his death in 1666 at the age of 70 . </P> <P> During the English occupation of Acadia , Jean - Baptiste Colbert , Louis XIV 's minister , forbade the Acadians from returning to France . As a result of the English occupation , no new French families settled in Acadia between 1654 and 1670 . </P> <H3> Post Treaty of Breda ( edit ) </H3> Marker commemorating the Dutch conquest of Acadia ( 1674 ) , which they renamed New Holland . This is the spot where Jurriaen Aernoutsz buried a bottle at the capital of Acadia , Fort Pentagouet , Castine , Maine . <P> The Treaty of Breda , signed 31 July 1667 , returned Acadia to France . A year later , Marillon du Bourg arrived to take possession of the territory for France . The son of LeBorgne , Alexandre LeBorgne , was named provisionary governor and lieutenant - general of Acadia . He married Marie Motin - La Tour , the eldest child of the marriage between La Tour and d'Aulnay's widow . </P> <P> In 1670 , the new governor of Acadia , the chevalier Hubert d'Andigny , chevalier de Grandfontaine , was responsible for the first census undertaken in Acadia . The results did not include those Acadians living with local First Nations . It revealed that there were approximately sixty Acadian families with approximately 300 inhabitants in total . These inhabitants were predominantly engaged in aboiteau farming along the shores of the present day Bay of Fundy . No serious attempt was made to increase the population of Acadia . </P> <P> In the spring of 1671 , more than fifty colonists left La Rochelle aboard the l'Oranger . Others arrived from Canada ( New France ) or were retired soldiers . During this time , a number of colonists married with the local First Nations . Some of the first to marry were Charles de Saint - \\u00c9tienne de La Tour , Martin , Pierr\\u00e9 Lejeune -- Briard , Jehan Lambert , Petitpas and Guidry . The capitan , Vincent de Saint - Castin , the commander at Pentagoet , married Marie Pidikiwamiska , the daughter of an Abenakis chief . </P> <P> In 1674 , the Dutch briefly conquered Acadia , renaming the colony New Holland . </P> <P> During the last decades of the seventeenth century , Acadians migrated from the capital , Port Royal , and established what would become the other major Acadian settlements before the Expulsion of the Acadians : Grand Pr\\u00e9 , Chignecto , Cobequid and Pisiguit . Although not common , on occasion epidemics ravished the population of Ile St. - Jean , Ile Royale and Acadia . In 1732 / 33 more than 150 people died of smallpox on Ile Royale . </P> <P> The history of the settlers of Ile St. - Jean prior to the expulsion includes extreme hardship . For almost every good harvest year it seems that there was one in which crops failed . In one or two instances widespread fires destroyed crops , livestock and farms . Famine and starvation were common and frequently occasioned desperate pleas for supplies from Louisbourg , Qu\\u00e9bec and even France itself . In 1756 , famine on Ile St. - Jean prompted authorities to relocate some families to Qu\\u00e9bec . </P> <P> Prior to the founding of Halifax ( 1749 ) , Port Royal / Annapolis Royal was the capital of Acadia and later Nova Scotia for most of the previous 150 years . During that time the British made six attempts to conquer Acadia by defeating the capital . They finally defeated the French in the Siege of Port Royal ( 1710 ) . Over the following fifty years , the French and their allies made six unsuccessful military attempts to regain the capital . </P> <H2> Colonial wars ( edit ) </H2> Acadians at Annapolis Royal by Samuel Scott , 1751 ; earliest known image of Acadians Main article : Military history of the Acadians <P> There was already a long history of Acadian and Wabanaki Confederacy resistance to the British occupation of Acadia during the four French and Indian Wars and two local wars ( Father Rale 's War and Father Le Loutre 's War ) before the Expulsion of the Acadians . The Mi'kmaq and the Acadians were allies through Catholicism and through numerous inter-marriages . The Mi'kmaq held the military strength in Acadia even after the conquest of 1710 . They primarily resisted the British occupation of Acadia and were joined in their efforts on numerous occasions by Acadians . </P> <P> While many Acadians traded with the New England Protestants , Acadians ' participation in the wars clearly indicated that many were reluctant to be ruled by the British . During the first colonial war , King William 's War ( 1688 -- 97 ) , the crews of the very successful French privateer Pierre Maisonnat dit Baptiste were primarily Acadian . The Acadians resisted during the Raid on Chignecto ( 1696 ) . During Queen Anne 's War , Mi'kmaq and Acadians resisted during the Raid on Grand Pr\\u00e9 , Piziquid and Chignecto in 1704 . The Acadians also assisted the French in protecting the capital in the Siege of Port Royal ( 1707 ) and the final Conquest of Acadia . The Acadians and Mi'kmaq were also successful in the Battle of Bloody Creek ( 1711 ) . </P> Acadians by Samuel Scott , Annapolis Royal , 1751 <P> During Father Rale 's War , the Maliseet raided numerous vessels on the Bay of Fundy while the Mi'kmaq engaged in the Raid on Canso , Nova Scotia ( 1723 ) . In the latter engagement , the Mi'kmaq were aided by Acadians . During King George 's War , Abbe Jean - Louis Le Loutre led many efforts which involved both Acadians and Mi'kmaq to recapture the capital such as the Siege of Annapolis Royal ( 1744 ) . During this siege , French officer Marin had taken British prisoners and stopped with them further up the bay at Cobequid . While at Cobequid , an Acadian said that the French soldiers should have `` left their ( the English ) carcasses behind and brought their skins '' . Le Loutre was also joined by prominent Acadian resistance leader Joseph Broussard ( Beausoleil ) . Broussard and other Acadians were involved in supporting the French soldiers in the Battle of Grand Pr\\u00e9 . </P> <P> During Father Le Loutre 's War , the conflict continued . The Mi'kmaq attacked New England Rangers in the Siege of Grand Pr\\u00e9 and Battle at St. Croix . Upon the founding of Dartmouth , Nova Scotia , Broussard and the Mi'kmaq conducted numerous raids on the village , such as the Raid on Dartmouth ( 1751 ) , to try to stop the Protestant migration into Nova Scotia . ( Similarly , during the French and Indian War , Mi'kmaq , Acadians and Maliseet also engaged in numerous raids on Lunenburg , Nova Scotia , to stop the migration , such as the Raid on Lunenburg ( 1756 ) . ) Le Loutre and Broussard also worked together to resist the British occupation of Chignecto ( 1750 ) and then later they fought together with Acadians in the Battle of Beausejour ( 1755 ) . ( As early as the summer of 1751 , La Valiere reported , approximately 250 Acadians had already enrolled in the local militia at Fort Beausejour . ) </P> <P> When Charles Lawrence took over the post following Hopson 's return to England , he took a stronger stance . He was not only a government official but a military leader for the region . Lawrence came up with a military solution for the forty - five years of an unsettled British conquest of Acadia . The French and Indian War ( and Seven Years ' War in Europe ) began in 1754 . Lawrence 's primary objectives in Acadia were to defeat the French fortifications at Beausejour and Louisbourg . The British saw many Acadians as a military threat in their allegiance to the French and Mi'kmaq . The British also wanted to interrupt the Acadian supply lines to Fortress Louisbourg , which , in turn , supplied the Mi'kmaq . </P> <H3> French and Indian War ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Great Upheaval St. John River Campaign : Raid on Grimrose ( present day Gagetown , New Brunswick ) . This is the only contemporaneous image of the Expulsion of the Acadians . <P> The British Conquest of Acadia happened in 1710 . Over the next forty - five years the Acadians refused to sign an unconditional oath of allegiance to Britain . During this time period Acadians participated in various militia operations against the British and maintained vital supply lines to the French Fortress of Louisbourg and Fort Beausejour . During the French and Indian War , the British sought to neutralize any military threat Acadians posed and to interrupt the vital supply lines Acadians provided to Louisbourg by deporting Acadians from Acadia . </P> <P> Many Acadians might have signed an unconditional oath to the British monarchy had the circumstances been better , while other Acadians did not sign because they were clearly anti-British . For the Acadians who might have signed an unconditional oath , there were numerous reasons why they did not . The difficulty was partly religious , in that the British monarch was the head of the ( Protestant ) Church of England . Another significant issue was that an oath might commit male Acadians to fight against France during wartime . A related concern was whether their Mi'kmaq neighbours might perceive this as acknowledging the British claim to Acadia rather than the Mi'kmaq . As a result , signing an unconditional oath might have put Acadian villages in danger of attack from Mi'kmaq . </P> <P> In the Grand D\\u00e9rangement ( the Great Upheaval ) , more than 12,000 Acadians ( three - fourths of the Acadian population in Nova Scotia ) were expelled from the colony between 1755 and 1764 . The British destroyed around 6,000 Acadian houses and dispersed the Acadians among the 13 colonies from Massachusetts to Georgia . The single event that involved the most deaths of Acadians was the sinking of the Duke William . Although there were no purposeful attempts to separate families , this did occur in the chaos of the eviction . </P> Siege of Louisbourg ( 1758 ) Acadian and Mi'kmaq resistance ( edit ) Marquis de Boish\\u00e9bert - Charles Deschamps de Boish\\u00e9bert et de Raffetot ( 1753 ) <P> With the Expulsion of the Acadians during the French and Indian War , the Mi'kmaq and Acadian resistance intensified . After the Expulsion began , much of the resistance was led by Charles Deschamps de Boish\\u00e9bert et de Raffetot . The Acadians and Mi'kmaq again engaged victoriously in the Battle of Petitcodiac ( 1755 ) and the Battle of Bloody Creek ( 1757 ) . Acadians who were being deported from Annapolis Royal , Nova Scotia , on the ship Pembroke defeated the British crew and sailed to land . There was also resistance during the St. John River Campaign . Boishebert also ordered the Raid on Lunenburg ( 1756 ) . In the spring of 1756 , a wood - gathering party from Fort Monckton ( former Fort Gaspareaux ) , was ambushed and nine of them were scalped . </P> <P> In the April 1757 , a band of Acadian and Mi'kmaq raided a warehouse near Fort Edward , killing thirteen British soldiers and , after taking what provisions they could carry , setting fire to the building . A few days later , the same partisans also raided Fort Cumberland . </P> <P> Some Acadians escaped into the woods and lived with the Mi'kmaq ; some bands of partisans fought the British , including a group led by Joseph Broussard , known as `` Beausoleil '' , along the Petitcodiac River of New Brunswick . Some followed the coast northward , facing famine and disease . Some were recaptured , facing deportation or imprisonment at Fort Beausejour ( renamed Fort Cumberland ) until 1763 . </P> <P> Some Acadians became indentured servants in the British colonies . Massachusetts passed a law in November 1755 placing the Acadians under the custody of `` justices of the peace and overseers of the poor '' ; Pennsylvania , Maryland , and Connecticut adopted similar laws . The Province of Virginia under Robert Dinwiddie initially agreed to resettle about one thousand Acadians who arrived in the colony but later ordered most deported to England , writing that the `` French people '' were `` intestine enemies '' that were `` murdering and scalping our frontier Settlers '' . </P> <P> In 1758 , after the fall of Louisbourg , over 3,000 Acadians were deported to northern France . Resettlement attempts were tried in Ch\\u00e2tellerault , Nantes , and Belle \\u00cele off Brittany . The French islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon near Newfoundland became a safe harbor for many Acadian families until they were once again deported by the British in 1778 and 1793 . </P> <H3> Re-establishing in Nova Scotia ( edit ) </H3> <P> After the end of the Seven Years ' War in 1763 , Acadians were allowed to return to Nova Scotia as long as they did not settle in any one area in large numbers ; they were not permitted to resettle in the areas of Port Royal or Grand - Pr\\u00e9 . Some Acadians resettled along the Nova Scotia coast and remain scattered across Nova Scotia to this day . Many dispersed Acadians looked for other homes . Beginning in 1764 , groups of Acadians began to arrive in Louisiana ( which had passed to Spanish control in 1762 ) . They eventually became known as Cajuns . </P> <P> Beginning in the 1770s , many Acadians were encouraged to return through the policies of Nova Scotia Governor Michael Francklin , who guaranteed Catholic worship , land grants and issued a promise that there would be no second expulsion ( At this time , Nova Scotia included present - day New Brunswick ) . However the fertile Acadian dykelands had been resettled by New England Planters , who were soon followed by Loyalists who further occupied former Acadian lands . Returning Acadians and those families who had escaped expulsion had to settle in other parts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick , in most cases isolated and infertile lands . The new Acadian settlements were forced to focus more on fishery and later forestry . </P> <P> Milestones of Acadian return and resettlement included : </P> <Ul> <Li> 1767 St. Pierre et Miquelon </Li> <Li> 1772 census </Li> <Li> 1774 Founding of Saint - Anne 's church ; the Acadian school at Rustico and the abby Jean - Louis Beaubien ; the Trappistines in Tracadie </Li> <Li> 1785 Displacement from Fort Sainte - Anne to the upper Saint John River valley ( Madawaska ) </Li> </Ul> <H2> Nineteenth century ( edit ) </H2> <P> Milestones of Acadian return and resettlement included : </P> <Ul> <Li> Jean - Mand\\u00e9 Sigogne ( 6 April 1763 -- 9 November 1844 ) was a French Catholic priest , who moved to Canada after the Revolution and became known for his missionary work among the Acadians of Nova Scotia . </Li> <Li> 1836 Simon d'Entremont and Fr\\u00e9d\\u00e9ric Robichaud , MLAs in N.S. </Li> <Li> 1846 Amand Landry , MLA in N.B. </Li> <Li> 1847 , Longfellow publishes Evangeline </Li> <Li> 1854 , Stanislaw - Francois Poirier , MLA in P.E.I </Li> <Li> 1854 , the seminary Saint - Thomas in Memramcook , New Brunswick , becomes the first upper - level school for Acadians </Li> <Li> 1859 , the first history of Acadia is published in French by Edme Rameau de Saint - P\\u00e8re ; Acadians begin to become aware of their own existence </Li> </Ul> <H3> Acadian Renaissance ( edit ) </H3> Le Moniteur Acadien - first Acadian newspaper ( 1867 ) <Ul> <Li> 1864 founding of the Farmers ' Bank of Rustico , the earliest known community bank in Canada , under the leadership of Rev.

First elected to the legislature in 1952 , he became provincial Liberal leader in 1958 and led his party to victory in 1960 , 1963 , and 1967 . </P> <P> Robichaud modernized the province 's hospitals and public schools and introduced a wide range of reforms in an era that became known as the quiet revolution . To carry out these reforms , Robichaud restructured the municipal tax regime , expanded the government and sought to ensure that the quality of health care , education and social services was the same across the province -- a programme he called equal opportunity , is still a buzzword in New Brunswick . </P> <P> Critics accused of Robichaud 's government of `` robbing Peter to pay Pierre '' with the assumption being that rich municipalities were Anglophone ones and poor municipalities were Francophone ones . While it was true that the wealthier municipalities were predominantly in certain English - speaking areas , areas with significantly inferior services were to be found across the province in all municipalities . </P> <P> Robichaud was instrumental in the formation of New Brunswick 's only French - speaking university , the Universit\\u00e9 de Moncton , in 1963 , which serves the Acadian population of the Maritime provinces . </P> <P> His government also passed an act in 1969 making New Brunswick officially bilingual . `` Language rights '' , he said when he introduced the legislation , `` are more than legal rights . They are precious cultural rights , going deep into the revered past and touching the historic traditions of all our people .

Maillet received a BA and MA from the Universit\\u00e9 de Moncton , followed by a Ph. D. in literature in 1970 from the Universit\\u00e9 Laval . Maillet won the 1972 Governor General 's Award for Fiction for Don l'Orignal . In 1979 , Maillet published P\\u00e9lagie - la - Charrette , for which she won the prix Goncourt . Maillet 's character `` La Sagouine '' ( from her book of the same name ) is the inspiration for `` Le Pays de la Sagouine '' in her hometown of Bouctouche . </P> <H2> Twenty - first century ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 2003 , at the request of Acadian representatives , a proclamation was issued in the name of Queen Elizabeth II , acting as the Canadian monarch , officially acknowledging the deportation and establishing July 28 as a day of commemoration . The day of commemoration is observed by the Government of Canada , as the successor of the British Government . </P> <H3> Acadian remembrance day ( edit ) </H3> <P> The F\\u00e9d\\u00e9ration des Associations de Familles Acadiennnes of New Brunswick and the Soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 Saint - Thomas d'Aquin of Prince Edward Island has resolved that December 13 each year shall be commemorated as `` Acadian Remembrance Day '' in remembrance of all Acadians who died as a result of the deportation . The date December 13 was chosen to commemorate the sinking of the Duke William and the nearly 2000 Acadians deported from \\u00cele - Saint Jean who perished in the North Atlantic from hunger , disease and drowning in 1758 . The event has been commemorated annually since 2004 and participants mark the event by wearing a black star . </P> <H3> Acadian World Congress ( edit ) </H3> <P> Beginning in 1994 , the Acadian community gathered for an Acadian World Congress in New Brunswick . The congress has been held every 5 years since then : in Louisiana in 1999 , in Nova Scotia in 2004 , in the Acadian Peninsula of New Brunswick in 2009 . The 5th Acadian World Congress was hosted in 2014 by a gathering of 40 different communities located in three different provinces and different states in two countries . Northwestern New Brunswick and T\\u00e9miscouata , Quebec , in Canada as well as Northern Maine in the United States joined hands to host the 5th CMA . </P> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ For information of m\\u00e9tis Acadians see : John Parmenter and Mark Power Robison .

They cover most of the North Carolina coastline , separating the Currituck Sound , Albemarle Sound , and Pamlico Sound from the Atlantic Ocean . </P> <P> The Outer Banks are a major tourist destination and are known around the world for their subtropical climate and wide expanse of open beachfront . The Cape Hatteras National Seashore has four campgrounds open to visitors . The treacherous seas off the Outer Banks and the large number of shipwrecks that have occurred there have given these seas the nickname Graveyard of the Atlantic . The Graveyard of the Atlantic Museum is located in Hatteras Village near a United States Coast Guard facility and the Hatteras ferry . </P> <P> The English Roanoke Colony -- where Virginia Dare was born -- vanished from Roanoke Island in 1587 . The Lost Colony , written and performed to commemorate the original colonists , is the second longest running outdoor drama in the United States and its theater acts as a cultural focal point for much of the Outer Banks . </P> <P> The Wright brothers ' first flight in a controlled , powered , heavier - than - air vehicle took place on the Outer Banks on December 17 , 1903 , at Kill Devil Hills near the seafront town of Kitty Hawk . The Wright Brothers National Monument commemorates the historic flights , and First Flight Airport is a small , general - aviation airfield located there . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Geography </Li> <Li> 2 Vegetation </Li> <Li> 3 Weather </Li> <Li> 4 Culture </Li> <Li> 5 Fishing </Li> <Li> 6 Communities <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Currituck Banks </Li> <Li> 6.2 Bodie Island </Li> <Li> 6.3 Roanoke Island </Li> <Li> 6.4 Hatteras Island </Li> <Li> 6.5 Ocracoke Island </Li> <Li> 6.6 Core Banks </Li> <Li> 6.7 Bogue Banks </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 Parks </Li> <Li> 8 Notable residents </Li> <Li> 9 See also </Li> <Li> 10 References </Li> <Li> 11 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Geography ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Outer Banks is a string of peninsulas and barrier islands separating the Atlantic Ocean from mainland North Carolina . From north to south , the largest of these include : Bodie Island ( which used to be an island but is now a peninsula due to tropical storms and hurricanes ) , Hatteras Island , Ocracoke Island , Portsmouth Island , and the Core Banks . Over time , the exact number of islands and inlets changes as new inlets are opened up , often during a breach created during violent storms , and older inlets close , usually due to gradually sifting sands during the dynamic processes of beach evolution . </P> <P> The Outer Banks stretch southward from Sandbridge in Virginia Beach down the North Carolina coastline . Sources differ regarding the southern terminus of the Outer Banks . Generations of North Carolina schoolchildren have learned that the term includes the state 's three prominent capes : Cape Hatteras , Cape Lookout , and Cape Fear . Other sources limit the definition to two capes ( Cape Hatteras and Cape Lookout ) and coastal areas in four counties ( Currituck County , Dare County , Hyde County , and Carteret County ) . Some authors include Carteret 's Shackelford Banks and Bogue Banks in their descriptions , while others exclude Bogue Banks . Still other references restrict the definition to the northern three counties of Currituck , Dare , and Hyde . </P> <P> The abbreviations OBX ( Outer Banks ) and SOBX ( Southern Outer Banks ) are modern terms used to promote tourism and to market a variety of stickers , t - shirts , and other items to vacationers . OBX , which originated first , is generally used in the northern Outer Banks . SOBX is used primarily in Carteret County , which is also known as the Crystal Coast . </P> <P> The northern part of the Outer Banks , from Oregon Inlet northward , is actually a part of the North American mainland , since the northern inlets of Bodie Island and Currituck Banks no longer exist . It is separated by the Currituck Sound and the Intracoastal Waterway , which passes through the Great Dismal Swamp occupying much of the mainland west of the Outer Banks . Road access to the northern Outer Banks is cut off between Sandbridge and Corolla , North Carolina , with communities such as Carova Beach accessible only by four - wheel drive vehicles . North Carolina State Highway 12 links most of the popular Outer Banks communities in this section of the coast . The easternmost point is Cape Point at Cape Hatteras on Hatteras Island , site of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse . </P> <P> The Outer Banks are not anchored to offshore coral reefs like some other barrier islands and as a consequence they often suffer significant beach erosion during major storms . In fact , their location jutting out into the Atlantic makes them the most hurricane - prone area north of Florida , for both landfalling storms and brushing storms offshore . Hatteras Island was cut in half on September 18 , 2003 , when Hurricane Isabel washed a 2,000 foot ( 600 m ) wide and 15 foot ( 5 m ) deep channel called Isabel Inlet through the community of Hatteras Village on the southern end of the island . The tear was subsequently repaired and restored by sand dredging by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers . It was cut off once again in 2011 by Hurricane Irene . Access to the island was largely limited to boat access only from August to late October until another temporary bridge could be built . </P> <H2> Vegetation ( edit ) </H2> <P> The vegetation of the Outer Banks varies . In the northeast part of the Outer Banks , from Virginia Beach southward past the North Carolina border to Oregon Inlet , the main types of vegetation are sea grasses , beach grasses and other beach plants including Opuntia humifusa on the Atlantic side and wax myrtles , bays , and grasses on the Sound side with areas of pine and Spanish moss - covered live oaks . Yucca aloifolia and Yucca gloriosa can be found growing wild here in the northern parts of its range on the beach . Sabal Minor palms were once indigenous to the entire Outer Banks , and they are still successfully planted and grown . Its current most northerly known native stand is on Monkey Island in Currituck County . </P> <P> From Cape Hatteras National Seashore southward , the vegetation does include that of the northeastern Outer Banks such as Sabal minor , Yucca aloifolia and Yucca gloriosa ; however , the main vegetation consists of Cabbage palmetto ( Sabal palmetto ) , which can be found in the north , although they are native in the southern part of the Outer Banks , specifically prevalent from Cape Hatteras and all points southward . Pindo palms and windmill palms are also planted widely throughout the Outer Banks ; although , they are not indigenous to the area . </P> <P> A wide variety of native plants can be found at the Elizabethan Gardens in Manteo on Roanoke Island . The gardens are open year round , 7 days a week . </P> <H2> Weather ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Outer Banks have unusual weather patterns because of their unique geographical location . As the islands are jutted out from the eastern seaboard into the Atlantic Gulf Stream , the Outer Banks has a predisposition to be affected by hurricanes , Nor'easters ( usually in the form of rain , and rarely snow or mixed precipitation ) , and other ocean - driven storms . </P> <P> The winters are typically milder than in inland areas , averaging lows in the upper 30s and highs in the lower 50s , and is more frequently overcast than in the summer . However , the exposure of the Outer Banks makes them prone to higher winds , often causing wind chills to make the apparent temperature as cold as the inland areas . The summer months average lows from the mid-70s to highs in the upper 80s , depending on the time of the summer . The spring and fall are typically milder seasons . The fall and winter are usually warmer than areas inland , while the spring and the summer are often slightly cooler because of the moderating effects of being surrounded by water . </P> <P> Although snow is possible , averaging from 3 inches in the north to less than 1 / 2 inch per year in the south , there are many times when years pass between snowfalls . The majority of nor'easters are `` born '' off the coasts of the Outer Banks . </P> <H2> Culture ( edit ) </H2> Graveyard of the Atlantic Museum , Hatteras , North Carolina , June 2007 <P> Archeologists believe that the Outer Banks were inhabited for well over a thousand years before the arrival of Europeans , with small branches of larger tribes , such as Algonquins , Chowanog , and Poteskeet , setting up homes all along the barrier islands from Corolla to Hatteras . European explorers to the Outer Banks as far back as the 1500s noted encountering the friendly Hatteras Island and Outer Banks natives , noting their hospitality to foreign explorers as well as their happiness and overall quality of life . European - borne diseases and migration to the mainland were likely the main causes for the decline of the native population . </P> <P> Before bridges were built in the 1930s , the only form of transport between or off the islands was by boat , which allowed for the islands to stay isolated from much of the rest of the mainland . This helped to preserve the maritime culture and the distinctive Outer Banks accent or brogue , which sounds more like an English accent than it does an American accent . Many `` bankers '' have often been mistaken for being from England or Ireland when traveling to areas outside of the Outer Banks . The brogue is more distinctive the further south one travels on the Outer Banks , with it being the thickest on Ocracoke Island and Harkers Island . </P> <P> Some residents of the Outer Banks , known as wreckers , made part of their living by scavenging wrecked ships -- or by luring ships to their destruction . Horses with lanterns tied to their necks would be walked along the beach ; the lanterns ' up and down motion would appear to ships to represent clear water and a ship ahead ; the unsuspecting captain would then drive his ship ashore following this false light . </P> <P> The islands are home to herds of feral horses , sometimes called `` banker ponies , '' which according to local legend are descended from Spanish Mustangs washed ashore centuries ago in shipwrecks . Populations are found on Ocracoke Island , Shackleford Banks , Currituck Banks , and in the Rachel Carson Estuarine Sanctuary . </P> <P> Ocracoke was the last refuge of pirate Edward Teach , better known as Blackbeard . It is also where the infamous pirate was killed November 22 , 1718 in a fierce battle with troops from Virginia . </P> <P> The Outer Banks is home to Yaupon Holly ( Ilex vomitoria ) , the roasted leaves of which were brewed into a high caffeine beverage called black drink by the Native Americans . The Outer Banks may be one of the few places where it is still consumed . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Fishing ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section contains content that is written like an advertisement .

There has been a long history of fishing in the Outer Banks , dating back to the end of the 17th century . Pirates ravaged the coast for the majority of the 1600s , but once they were ridden , the local settlers used fishing as their lifeline . Then , in the mid-19th century , large - scale commercial fishing erupted , mostly due to the construction of the Albemarle and Chesapeake Canal , which simplified shipping methods for fishermen . Saltwater fishing became the cash - crop of the Outer Banks , and blossomed it into a popular tourist destination . In modern times , tourists will flock to the area just for the abundance of fishing opportunities . Anglers , otherwise known as fishermen , have a wide range of fishing methods , some of these methods date back to when the first settlers arrived , to choose from in the Outer Banks . </P> <Dl> <Dt> Fly fishing </Dt> <Dd> This was brought about in the 1950s when modern fly fishing experts like , Joe Brooks and Jimmy Albright , were successfully catching a variety of gamefish on the flats of the Florida Keys and on the Currituck Sound , which is included in the stretch of the Outer Banks . Modern fly fishers in the Outer Banks pursue a variety of gamefish from red drum , to marlin and tuna . </Dd> <Dt> Brackish fishing </Dt> <Dd> This is a separate type of fishing than complete saltwater because of the abundance of new species that are able to live in brackish water . The Outer Banks has multiple Sounds that receive water from the Atlantic Ocean and many North Carolina fresh - water rivers , creating an estuary for many types of fish including , striped bass , puppy drum , and speckled trout . </Dd> <Dt> Offshore fishing </Dt> <Dd> Thriving in the Outer Banks , this is the type of fishing this area is known for . Offshore fishing is the method of heading out to sea to the Gulf Stream , where giant species such as billfish , tuna and dolphin lurk . Anglers can book charters or use their own personal boat , but a larger boat is necessary to reach the deep water where the big fish are prevalent . </Dd> <Dt> Inshore fishing </Dt> <Dd> Guides local to the Outer Banks will often escort new anglers around the area to sounds and piers where they are guaranteed a catch . Whether the customer is a novice or veteran with their fishing skills , the inshore guide is someone that is there to help . </Dd> <Dt> Pier fishing </Dt> <Dd> The Outer Banks are one of the few coastal areas left with more than one fishing pier along the coast , so anglers attract to the area for an opportunity to pier fish . Pier Fishing is an easy way for anglers to get a little off - shore mixed with some inshore fishing . It is where fishermen can catch any type of fish they please , as long as it is the season for it . </Dd> </Dl> <P> The Outer Banks are a popular destination for bottom fish like spot and mullet , these two types of fish are caught throughout the year . The peak for fishing bottom and top water feeders is early to the middle of May . If the angler is solely searching for top water fish , then late May and June would be the ideal time to fish , especially if they are searching for Mackerel . In the offseason , or winter months , the true fishermen are out searching for Trout , Sea Bass , Bluefish , Bluefin Tuna , Oysters , King Mackerel , Bay Scallops , and Striped Bass . In the spring , the popular catches are Grouper , Sea Trout , Sea Bass , Bluefish , Bluefin and Yellowfin tuna , Oysters , Snapper , Striped Bass , Red Drum , Croaker , Sea Mullet , King Mackerel , and Wahoo Late Spring and the beginning of summer is the favored time for top - water fish to move into the coastal waters near the Outer Banks , because of the warming waters and the increased visibility in the water The top water fish can see baitfish easily due to the decrease in murky water Plus they will start to migrate back North as the coastal waters to the south become too hot , the waters farther North will warm to their desired temperatures . Yet , in the prime tourist season of the summer , fishermen and many tourists have plenty of game options such as blue Marlin , White Marlin , Dolphin , Wahoo , Cobia , King Mackerel , Bluefish , Tuna , Flounder , snapper , Grouper , Spanish Mackerel , Crabs , Soft Crabs , Shrimp , Spot , Croaker , Sailfish , and Sea Mullet . By the fall , most tourists have started to leave , but fishermen are still out searching for Snapper , Channel Bass , Bluefish , King Mackerel , Grouper , Tuna , Oysters , Striped Bass , Sea Mullet , Spot , Clams , Speckled Trout , Flounder , and Shrimp . The prime season for fall fishing is late September to October 23 . Though the water is more turbulent and murky due to the strong northeast prevailing winds , there is still some big game fish left . Most of these fish are vacating back to the South for the warm waters . This makes it a prime time for smaller bottom fish who love to feed in murky , colder water . </P> <H2> Communities ( edit ) </H2> <P> Towns and communities along the Outer Banks include ( listed from north to south ) : </P> <H3> Currituck Banks ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> Sandbridge ( VA ) </Li> <Li> Carova Beach </Li> <Li> Corolla </Li> <Li> Knotts Island </Li> </Ul> <H3> Bodie Island ( edit ) </H3> Sunset over the Currituck Sound in Duck ( 2009 ) The Bodie Island Lighthouse ( October 2008 ) <Ul> <Li> Duck </Li> <Li> Southern Shores </Li> <Li> Kitty Hawk </Li> <Li> Kill Devil Hills </Li> <Li> Nags Head </Li> </Ul> <H3> Roanoke Island ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> Manteo </Li> <Li> Wanchese </Li> </Ul> <H3> Hatteras Island ( edit ) </H3> Sunset over Avon <Ul> <Li> Rodanthe </Li> <Li> Waves </Li> <Li> Salvo </Li> <Li> Avon </Li> <Li> Buxton </Li> <Li> Frisco </Li> <Li> Hatteras </Li> </Ul> <H3> Ocracoke Island ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> Ocracoke </Li> </Ul> <H3> Core Banks ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> Portsmouth Island </Li> </Ul> <H3> Bogue Banks ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> Atlantic Beach </Li> <Li> Pine Knoll Shores </Li> <Li> Indian Beach </Li> <Li> Salter Path </Li> <Li> Emerald Isle </Li> </Ul> <H2> Parks ( edit ) </H2> Jockey 's Ridge State Park <Ul> <Li> Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge </Li> <Li> Cape Hatteras National Seashore </Li> <Li> Cape Lookout National Seashore </Li> <Li> Currituck Heritage Park </Li> <Li> Currituck National Wildlife Refuge </Li> <Li> False Cape State Park </Li> <Li> Fort Macon State Park </Li> <Li> Fort Raleigh National Historic Site </Li> <Li> Jockey 's Ridge State Park </Li> <Li> Mackay Island National Wildlife Refuge </Li> <Li> Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge </Li> <Li> Wright Brothers National Memorial </Li> </Ul> <H2> Notable residents ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Andy Griffith ( 1926 -- 2012 ) , actor </Li> <Li> Dennis Anderson , professional Monster Truck driver and creator of Grave Digger . </Li> <Li> Edward Teach , ( 1680 - 1718 ) notorious English pirate , raided on the North Atlantic and Caribbean Sea . </Li> <Li> Manteo ( disappeared after 1587 ) influential figure in Croatoan Nation , ambassador to England and mediator . </Li> </Ul> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Crystal Coast ( Southern Outer Banks ) </Li> <Li> Hazard mitigation in the Outer Banks </Li> <Li> Historic Albemarle Tour </Li> <Li> Inner Banks </Li> <Li> North Carolina Highway 12 </Li> <Li> Outer Banks Daredevils </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Campgrounds '' .

It is located at South Africa House , a building on Trafalgar Square , London . As well as containing the offices of the High Commissioner , the building also hosts the South African consulate . It has been a Grade II * Listed Building since 1982 . <\\/P> <H2> Contents <\\/H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 History <\\/Li> <Li> 2 See also <\\/Li> <Li> 3 References <\\/Li> <Li> 4 External links <\\/Li> <\\/Ul> <H2> History ( edit ) <\\/H2> <P> South Africa House was built by Holland , Hannen & Cubitts in the 1930s on the site of what had been Morley 's Hotel until it was demolished in 1936 . The building was designed by Sir Herbert Baker , with architectural sculpture by Coert Steynberg and Sir Charles Wheeler , and opened in 1933 . The building was acquired by the government of South Africa as its main diplomatic presence in the UK . During World War II , Prime Minister Jan Smuts lived there while conducting South Africa 's war plans . <\\/P> <P> In 1961 , South Africa became a republic , and withdrew from the Commonwealth due to its policy of racial segregation . Accordingly , the building became an Embassy , rather than a High Commission . During the 1980s , the building , which was one of the only South African diplomatic missions in a public area , was targeted by protesters from around the world . During the 1990 Poll Tax Riots , the building was set alight by rioters , although not seriously damaged . <\\/P> <P> The first fully free democratic elections in South Africa were held on the 27 April 1994 , and 4 days later , the country rejoined the Commonwealth , 33 years to the day after it withdrew upon becoming a republic . Along with country 's diplomatic missions in other Commonwealth countries , the mission once again became a High Commission . <\\/P> <P> Today , South Africa House is no longer a controversial site , and is the focal point of South African culture in the UK . South African President Nelson Mandela appeared on the balcony of South Africa House in 1996 , as part of his official UK state visit . In 2001 , Mandela again appeared on the balcony of South Africa House to mark the seventh anniversary of Freedom Day , when the apartheid system was officially abolished . <\\/P> <H2> See also ( edit ) <\\/H2> <Ul> <Li> List of diplomatic missions of South Africa <\\/Li> <Li> High Commission of Canada to the United Kingdom <\\/Li> <Li> High Commission of Uganda , London <\\/Li> <\\/Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) <\\/H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> <\\/Td> <Td> Wikimedia Commons has media related to South Africa House , London . <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <\\/Table> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : `` The London Diplomatic List '' ( PDF ) . 14 December 2013 .

It originally aired on NBC on April 21 , 2011 . The episode was written and directed by co-executive producer Mindy Kaling . `` Michael 's Last Dundies '' guest stars Will Ferrell as Deangelo Vickers and Jack Coleman as State Senator Robert Lipton . <\\/P> <P> The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton , Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company . In the episode , Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) trains his office replacement , Deangelo Vickers ( Ferrell ) on how to properly host the branch 's annual Dundie Awards . Michael soon learns that Deangelo has a terrible problem with speaking in front of others . Meanwhile , Erin Hannon ( Ellie Kemper ) grows to dislike her boyfriend , Gabe Lewis ( Zach Woods ) . <\\/P> <P> The episode -- which was originally going to be called `` Goodbye , Michael Part 1 '' -- was the first installment in the series to be both written and directed by Kaling , who also portrays Kelly Kapoor on the series . The episode also marks the second appearance of Ferrell as Deangelo Vickers ; Ferrell had signed onto the series to make Carell 's exit transition easier . The episode received mostly positive reviews from television critics . `` Michael 's Last Dundies '' was viewed by 6.849 million viewers and received a 3.3 rating among adults between the age of 18 and 49 . The episode was the highest - rated NBC series of the week that it aired , as well as the sixth-most watched episode in the 18 -- 49 demographic for the week it aired . <\\/P> <H2> Contents <\\/H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot <\\/Li> <Li> 2 Production <\\/Li> <Li> 3 Cultural references <\\/Li> <Li> 4 Reception <\\/Li> <Li> 5 References <\\/Li> <Li> 6 External links <\\/Li> <\\/Ul> <H2> Plot ( edit ) <\\/H2> <P> At the office , Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) announces to the employees that Deangelo Vickers ( Will Ferrell ) will be his co-host at the Dundies . The Dundies are an annual award program created by Michael to motivate his employees . The idea of performance is worrisome to Deangelo , but Michael insists he take the job . Michael brings some of the staff together in the conference room to help Deangelo get prepared for the show , but he struggles to be humorous . Andy Bernard ( Ed Helms ) tries to help him , saying he should just think of performing like conducting a meeting , but Michael objects , wanting Deangelo to mimic his style . Michael tries a number of different things to help Deangelo , such as sitting on his stomach and making him listen to a Walkman at full volume so he can not hear himself think , but none are effective . <\\/P> <P> Meanwhile , Jim ( John Krasinski ) and Pam Halpert ( Jenna Fischer ) see Erin Hannon ( Ellie Kemper ) sitting in her car eating a sandwich . She explains that she has begun eating lunch in her car to get some time away from Gabe Lewis ( Zach Woods ) , whom she is starting to despise . Pam advises Erin to tell Gabe her real feelings as soon as possible . This amuses Jim , given Pam 's history with Roy Anderson , and he leaves in order to avoid the temptation to comment on the irony . <\\/P> <P> After work , the employees arrive at an Italian restaurant named Louie Volpe 's to celebrate the Dundies . Moments after being introduced , Deangelo disappears into the bathroom to vomit . Eventually , Michael is able to psych him up , and the show begins . The show continues to go poorly , with most of Michael 's jokes offending more than amusing the employees . Dwight wins the `` Promising Assistant Manager '' Dundie , but as he is still mad at Michael for not recommending he replace Michael , he tosses his award in the trash . Erin wins the `` Cutest Redhead '' award and gives a speech in which she breaks up with Gabe , who takes the stage to protest , then leaves in humiliation . Michael awards Deangelo with the `` Best Dundies Host '' award . The staff urges him to make a speech , but as he nervously tries to yell over his Walkman , the ceremony is kicked out of the restaurant . Michael is upset that his last Dundies Award show was a disappointment , but the staff convinces him to continue the event at the office . <\\/P> <P> After Dwight , still angry with Michael , insults the Dundies and leaves , Michael and Deangelo continue the event in the conference room . After the last award , Andy leads the employees in serenading the soon - to - depart Michael with an altered version of the song `` Seasons of Love '' ; Michael is touched . <\\/P> <H2> Production ( edit ) <\\/H2> `` Michael 's Last Dundies '' marked Will Ferrell 's second appearance on The Office . <P> `` Michael 's Last Dundies '' was written and directed by co-executive producer Mindy Kaling , the first time that she has both directed and written an episode of the series . Kaling was also the writer of the second season episode `` The Dundies '' , an episode to which `` Michael 's Last Dundies '' serves as a sequel in many ways . The episode was originally titled `` Goodbye , Michael Part 1 '' before NBC announced that `` Goodbye , Michael '' would be an extended 36 - minute episode and this episode was re-titled `` Michael 's Last Dundies '' . In the episode , a cue card features Dwight 's last name spelled incorrectly as `` Shrute '' . Kaling later admitted on Twitter that she had spelled the name that way `` in every script I 've written since ' Hot Girl ' . '' <\\/P> <P> The episode is the second of Will Ferrell 's four - episode guest stint on the series . Ferrell signed on to appear in Carell 's final three episodes , and the first episode without Carell , `` The Inner Circle '' , to make Carell 's transition easier . Ferrell initially called the producers and offered to appear in a few episodes in Carell 's last season , because he is `` a fan and wanted to commemorate Carell 's swan song '' . He had previously starred alongside Carell , in the 2004 film , Anchorman : The Legend of Ron Burgundy . <\\/P> <P> The Season Seven DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode . Notable cut scenes include Michael talking about his last Dundies using comedians as metaphors , Dwight booing Deangelo in order to adequately prepare him for his actual speech , various clips from the actual Dundies awards and of people accepting their awards , a cut scene featuring a video of Michael interviewing Danny Cordray ( Timothy Olyphant ) at his house , and Andy talking to Erin about loading the printer so that she can take her mind off of Gabe . <\\/P> <H2> Cultural references ( edit ) <\\/H2> <P> In this episode , Michael Scott describes the Dundies as `` like the Golden Globes but less mean '' referring to Ricky Gervais ' hosting of the 2011 Golden Globe Awards ; which left critics questioning if he had gone `` too far '' . As executive producer of the American series and creator of the original British series , Gervais stated on his blog that the line was inserted as a metajoke was intended as `` a little in - joke '' . Near the beginning of the episode , Deangelo compares Meredith Palmer 's ( Kate Flannery ) house to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina . Michael notes that `` When Larry King died , they did n't just cancel his show '' , showing that Michael is unaware that Larry King is not deceased . Later , he notes that `` they got Piers Morgan to come in and do his show '' instead . The final song that the office sings to Michael is a parody of `` Seasons of Love '' from the Broadway musical Rent . Dwight later reveals in a talking head that he is always the padawan learner , and never a Jedi knight , a reference to the 1977 film Star Wars and its franchise . Michael notes that he wanted his last Dundies celebration to be like the 1990 film The Godfather Part III , rather than the `` confusing '' 1972 film The Godfather I , which he notes had `` three big laughs '' . Additionally , the episode contains several references to the film The King 's Speech , notably during the scene in which Deangelo gives his speech at the Dundies while listening to his Walkman played at a high volume . <\\/P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) <\\/H2> <P> In its original American broadcast , `` Michael 's Last Dundies '' was viewed by an estimated 6.849 million households and received a 3.3 rating \\/ 10 % share in the 18 -- 49 demographic . This means that it was seen by 3.3 % of all 18 - to 49 - year - olds , and 9 % of all 18 - to 49 - year - olds watching television at the time of the broadcast . This marked a significant drop in the ratings from the previous episode , `` Training Day '' . Despite this , the episode became the highest - rated NBC program for the original week it aired and also became the sixth-most - watched show for the week of broadcast among adults aged 18 -- 49 . <\\/P> ' Michael 's Last Dundies ' obviously wants to take on a particular meaning given that final song ( ... ) As a result , I think it is perfectly fair to hold the show accountable for the fact that the rest of it was built around a transparent set of bits being played by two actors , not two characters , and to wish that the big picture was more than just a musical afterthought in Carell 's next - to - last episode . <P> Myles McNutt , The A.V. Club <\\/P> <P> The episode received a moderately positive review from Cindy White of IGN . She said `` the laughs were scarce this episode '' but the lack of humor was compensated by the `` emotional highlights '' . However , she praised the performances of many of the supporting cast . She ultimately gave the episode a 7 out of 10 , denoting a `` good '' episode . Alan Sepinwall of HitFix felt that the episode was `` very up - and - down '' , largely due to inconsistent writing . He did , however , feel that the ending song was `` beautiful '' and `` enough to justify '' the episode . Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode four - and - a-half stars out of five and called it `` funny and sweet '' and `` a perfect penultimate episode for Steve Carell '' . <\\/P> <P> Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a `` B -- '' . He felt that it was appropriate that Steve Carell 's time on the series was bookended largely by the Dundies ; he noted that the episode in which the awards were introduced -- the eponymous second season entry -- served as `` a second pilot of sorts '' for the series , and the idea to bring the Dundies back made sense at the time in order to see how the characters had grown . However , he felt that the episode at large did not live up to its source material , and that it was `` occasionally funny but unfortunately meaningless '' . The ending song , however , in McNutt 's opinion , was a highlight of the episode . <\\/P> <P> Will Ferrell 's character received criticism in the episode . White criticized Deangelo Vickers , noting that she did not have a handle on the character and that he was too `` downright normal '' and `` practically boring '' . McNutt argued that , while Ferrell `` is not really the problem with the role '' of Deangelo Vickers , the actions between Ferrell and Carell felt more like `` hanging out to commemorate the former 's departure from a television show '' rather than the two playing believable characters . He also felt that Deangelo `` feels disruptive to the show 's narrative '' because his character gets in the way of the plot . Sepinwall felt that parts of the episode fell flat because it spent `` so much time giving Will Ferrell stuff to do '' . He further noted that `` nobody has come up with a good reason for him being here other than that he 's Will Ferrell .

In the address , Bryan supported bimetallism or `` free silver '' , which he believed would bring the nation prosperity . He decried the gold standard , concluding the speech , `` you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold '' . Bryan 's address helped catapult him to the Democratic Party 's presidential nomination ; it is considered one of the greatest political speeches in American history . <\\/P> <P> For twenty years , Americans had been bitterly divided over the nation 's monetary standard . The gold standard , which the United States had effectively been on since 1873 , limited the money supply but eased trade with other nations , such as the United Kingdom , whose currency was also based on gold . Many Americans , however , believed that bimetallism ( making both gold and silver legal tender ) was necessary for the nation 's economic health . The financial Panic of 1893 intensified the debates , and when Democratic President Grover Cleveland continued to support the gold standard against the will of much of his party , activists became determined to take over the Democratic Party organization and nominate a silver - supporting candidate in 1896 . <\\/P> <P> Bryan had been a dark horse candidate with little support in the convention . His speech , delivered at the close of the debate on the party platform , electrified the convention and is generally credited with getting him the nomination for president . However , he lost the general election to William McKinley and the United States formally adopted the gold standard in 1900 . <\\/P> <H2> Contents <\\/H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Background <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Monetary standards and the United States <\\/Li> <Li> 1.2 Early attempts toward free silver <\\/Li> <Li> 1.3 Bryan seeks the nomination <\\/Li> <Li> 1.4 Selection of delegates <\\/Li> <\\/Ul> <\\/Li> <Li> 2 1896 convention <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Candidates for the nomination <\\/Li> <Li> 2.2 Silver advocates take control <\\/Li> <Li> 2.3 Bryan addresses the convention <\\/Li> <\\/Ul> <\\/Li> <Li> 3 Reception and nomination <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Convention events <\\/Li> <Li> 3.2 Press reaction <\\/Li> <\\/Ul> <\\/Li> <Li> 4 Campaign and aftermath <\\/Li> <Li> 5 Legacy <\\/Li> <Li> 6 References <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Bibliography <\\/Li> <\\/Ul> <\\/Li> <Li> 7 External links <\\/Li> <\\/Ul> <H2> Background ( edit ) <\\/H2> <H3> Monetary standards and the United States ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> In January 1791 , at the request of Congress , Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton issued a report on the currency . At the time , there was no mint in the United States ; foreign coins were used . Hamilton proposed a monetary system based on bimetallism , in which the new currency would be equal to a given amount of gold , or a larger amount of silver ; at the time a given weight of gold was worth about 15 times as much as the same amount of silver . Although Hamilton understood that adjustment might be needed from time to time as precious metal prices fluctuated , he believed that if the nation 's unit of value were defined only by one of the two precious metals used for coins , the other would descend to the status of mere merchandise , unusable as a store of value . He also proposed the establishment of a mint , at which citizens could present gold or silver , and receive it back , struck into money . On April 2 , 1792 , Congress passed the Mint Act of 1792 . This legislation defined a unit of value for the new nation , to be known as a dollar . The new unit of currency was defined to be equal to 24.75 grains ( 1.604 g ) of gold , or alternatively , 371.25 grains ( 24.057 g ) of silver , establishing a ratio of value between gold and silver of 15 : 1 . The legislation also established the Mint of the United States . <\\/P> <P> In the early 19th century , the economic disruption caused by the Napoleonic Wars caused United States gold coins to be worth more as bullion than as money , and they vanished from circulation . Governmental response to this shortage was hampered by the fact that officials did not clearly understand what had happened . In 1830 , Treasury Secretary Samuel D. Ingham proposed adjusting the ratio between gold and silver in US currency to 15.8 : 1 , which had for some time been the ratio in Europe . It was not until 1834 that Congress acted , changing the gold \\/ silver ratio to 16.002 : 1 . This was close enough to the market value to make it uneconomic to export either US gold or silver coins . When silver prices rose relative to gold as a reaction to the California Gold Rush , silver coinage was worth more than face value , and rapidly flowed overseas for melting . Despite vocal opposition led by Tennessee Representative ( and future president ) Andrew Johnson , the precious metal content of smaller silver coins was reduced in 1853 . Silver was now undervalued at the Mint ; accordingly little was presented for striking into money . <\\/P> <P> The Coinage Act of 1873 eliminated the standard silver dollar . It also repealed the statutory provisions allowing silver bullion to be presented to the Mint and returned in the form of circulating money . In passing the Coinage Act , Congress eliminated bimetallism . During the economic chaos of the Panic of 1873 , the price of silver dropped significantly , but the Mint would accept none for striking into legal tender . Silver producers complained , and many Americans came to believe that only through bimetallism could the nation achieve and maintain prosperity . They called for the return to pre-1873 laws , which would require the Mint to take all the silver offered it and return it , struck into silver dollars . This would inflate the money supply , and , adherents argued , increase the nation 's prosperity . Critics contended that the inflation which would follow the introduction of such a policy would harm workers , whose wages would not rise as fast as prices would , and the operation of Gresham 's law would drive gold from circulation , effectively placing the United States on a silver standard . <\\/P> <H3> Early attempts toward free silver ( edit ) <\\/H3> Congressman Richard P. Bland <P> To advocates of what became known as free silver , the 1873 act became known as the `` Crime of ' 73 '' . Pro-silver forces , with congressional leaders such as Missouri Representative Richard P. Bland , sought the passage of bills to allow depositors of silver bullion to receive it back in the form of coin . Such bills , sponsored by Bland , passed the House of Representatives in 1876 and 1877 , but both times failed in the Senate . A third attempt in early 1878 again passed the House , and eventually both houses after being amended in the Senate . The bill , as modified by amendments sponsored by Iowa Senator William B. Allison , did not reverse the 1873 provisions , but required the Treasury to purchase a minimum of $2 million of silver bullion per month ; the profit , or seignorage from monetizing the silver was to be used to purchase more silver bullion . The silver would be struck into dollar coins , to be circulated or else stored and used as backing for silver certificates . The Bland -- Allison Act was vetoed by President Rutherford B. Hayes , but was enacted by Congress over his veto on February 28 , 1878 . <\\/P> <P> Implementation of the Bland -- Allison Act did not end calls for free silver . The 1880s saw a steep decline in the prices of grain and other agricultural commodities . Silver advocates argued that this dropoff , which caused the price of grain to fall below its cost of production , was caused by the failure of the government to adequately increase the money supply , which had remained steady on a per capita basis . Advocates of the gold standard attributed the decline to advances in production and transportation . The late 19th century saw divergent views in economics as the laissez - faire orthodoxy was questioned by younger economists , and both sides found ample support for their views from theorists . <\\/P> <P> In 1890 , the Sherman Silver Purchase Act greatly increased government purchases of silver . The government pledged to stand behind the silver dollars and treasury notes issued under the act by redeeming them in gold . Pursuant to this promise , government gold reserves dwindled over the following three years . Although the economic Panic of 1893 had a number of causes , President Grover Cleveland believed the inflation caused by Sherman 's act to be a major factor , and called a special session of Congress to repeal it . Congress did so , but the debates showed bitter divides in both major parties between silver and gold factions . Cleveland tried to replenish the Treasury through issuance of bonds which could only be purchased with gold , with little effect but to increase the public debt , as the gold continued to be withdrawn in redemption for paper and silver currency . Many in the public saw the bonds as benefiting bankers , not the nation . The bankers ' feeling was that they did not want loans repaid in an inflated currency -- the gold standard was deflationary , and as creditors , they preferred to be paid in such a currency , whereas debtors preferred to repay in inflated currency . <\\/P> <P> The effects of the depression which began in 1893 , and which continued through 1896 , ruined many Americans . Contemporary estimates were an unemployment rate as high as 25 % . The task of relieving the jobless fell to churches and other charities , as well as to labor unions . Farmers went bankrupt ; their farms were sold to pay their debts . Some of the impoverished died of disease or starvation ; others killed themselves . <\\/P> <H3> Bryan seeks the nomination ( edit ) <\\/H3> For additional detail on the political career of William Jennings Bryan before and during the 1896 campaign , see William Jennings Bryan presidential campaign , 1896 . <P> Among those who spoke against the repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act was Nebraska Congressman William Jennings Bryan . Known as an orator even then , Bryan had not always favored free silver out of conviction , stating in 1892 that he was for it because the people of Nebraska were for it . By 1893 , his views on silver had evolved , and on the floor of the House of Representatives , he delivered a riveting three - hour address against repeal of the Silver Purchase Act . In his conclusion , Bryan reached back in history : <\\/P> <P> When a crisis like the present arose and the national bank of his day sought to control the politics of the nation , God raised up an Andrew Jackson , who had the courage to grapple with that great enemy , and by overthrowing it , he made himself the idol of the people and reinstated the Democratic party in public confidence . What will the decision be today ? The Democratic party has won the greatest success in its history . Standing upon this victory - crowned summit , will it turn its face to the rising or the setting sun ? Will it choose blessings or cursings -- life or death -- which ? Which ? <\\/P> <P> Despite the repeal of the act , economic conditions failed to improve . The year 1894 saw considerable labor unrest . President Cleveland sent federal troops to Illinois to end the Pullman strike -- workers at the Pullman Palace Car Company , which made railroad cars , had struck after wages were cut . Railway employees had refused to handle Pullman cars in sympathy with the strikers ; this action threatened to paralyze the nation 's rail lines . The President 's move was opposed by the Democratic Governor of Illinois , John Altgeld . Angered by Cleveland 's actions in the labor dispute , and by his uncompromising stand against silver , Altgeld began to organize Democrats against Cleveland 's renomination in 1896 . Although Altgeld and his adherents urged voters to distinguish between Cleveland and his party , the Democrats lost 113 seats in the House in the 1894 midterm elections , the greatest loss by a majority party in congressional history . The Republicans gained control of the House , as well as the Senate , which until 1913 was elected by the state legislatures rather than by the popular vote . Among those defeated for Senate was Bryan in Nebraska . <\\/P> <P> Bryan had long planned to run for president . Although he would only be 36 years old in 1896 -- one year above the constitutional minimum -- he believed the silver question could carry him not only to the nomination , but to the presidency . He traveled widely , speaking to audiences across the nation . His speeches impressed many ; even some of his opponents later conceded that Bryan was the most compelling speaker they had ever heard . Bryan 's speeches evolved over time ; in December 1894 , in a speech in Congress , he first used a phrase from which would come the conclusion to his most famous address : as originally stated , it was `` I will not help to crucify mankind upon a cross of gold . '' <\\/P> <P> A myth has arisen that Bryan was an unknown prior to 1896 . This was not the case ; Bryan was well known as an orator on the tariff and silver questions . Albert Shaw , editor of The Review of Reviews , stated that after Bryan 's nomination , many easterners professed not to have heard of him but : `` If , indeed , they had not heard of Mr. Bryan before , they had failed to follow closely the course of American politics in the past eight years . As a Democratic member of the Ways and Means Committee through two Congresses , Mr. Bryan was by all odds the ablest and strongest orator on the Democratic side of the House . His subsequent canvass ( campaign ) for the United States senatorship in Nebraska was noteworthy and conspicuous on many accounts . '' <\\/P> <P> In the aftermath of the 1894 election , the silver forces , led by Altgeld and others , began an attempt to take over the machinery of the Democratic Party . Historian Stanley Jones , in his study of the 1896 election , suggests that western Democrats would have opposed Cleveland even if the party had held its congressional majority in 1894 ; with the disastrous defeat , they believed the party would be wiped out in the West if it did not support silver . Bryan biographer Paulo E. Coletta wrote , `` during this year ( July 1894 -- June 1895 ) of calamities , disintegration and revolution , each crisis aided Bryan because it caused division within his party and permitted him to contest for its mastery as it slipped from Cleveland 's fingers . '' <\\/P> <P> In early 1896 , with the economy still poor , there was widespread discontent with the two existing major political parties . Some people , for the most part Democrats , joined the far - left Populist Party . Many Republicans in the western states , dismayed by the strong allegiance of eastern Republicans to the gold standard , considered forming their own party . When the Republicans in June 1896 nominated former Ohio Governor William McKinley for president and passed at his request a platform strongly supporting `` sound money '' ( the gold standard unless modified by international agreement ) , a number of `` Silver Republicans '' walked out of the convention . The leader of those who left was Colorado Senator Henry M. Teller ; he was immediately spoken of as a possible candidate for the Democratic nomination . <\\/P> <P> Bryan believed that he could , if nominated , unite the disaffected behind a strong silver campaign . However , part of his strategy was to remain inconspicuous until the last possible moment at the convention . He sent letters to national convention delegates , urging them to support silver , and enclosing copies of his photograph , writings , and speeches . Jones points out that though Bryan 's speaking engagements were not deemed political by the standards of 1896 , by modern measurements he was far more active in campaigning for the nomination than most of the better - known candidates . <\\/P> <P> Historian James A. Barnes , in his historical journal article pointing out myths that have arisen about Bryan 's candidacy and campaign , stated that Bryan 's efforts bore fruit even before the convention : <\\/P> <P> By April , 1896 , many individuals were quietly working for Bryan 's nomination . Circulars were being distributed in Illinois , and admirers in Nebraska , North Carolina , Mississippi , Louisiana , Texas , Arkansas , and other states were urging his selection among their friends . It was not in any concerted or open action , however , that Bryan had his strength ; it was in the friendly predisposition of the mass of the delegates that he had hopes . <\\/P> <H3> Selection of delegates ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> The 1896 Democratic National Convention followed events unique in post-Civil War American history . One after another , state conventions to elect delegates to the national convention in Chicago repudiated an incumbent elected president of their party , who had not declared whether he would be a candidate for renomination . According to Barnes : <\\/P> <P> The people of the South and the West had for years been convinced of the enormity of the `` crime of 1873 '' , and they had long since come to regard silver as the sword that would cut the Gordian knot of privilege . Consciousness of grievances of years and not of months was reflected in the decisive action of the state Democratic conventions in the spring and early summer of 1896 . <\\/P> <P> Many state conventions elected delegates pledged to support bimetallism in the party platform . Gold Democrats were successful in a few states in the Northeast , but had little luck elsewhere . Speakers in some states cursed Cleveland ; the South Carolina convention denounced him . Cleveland issued a statement urging Democratic voters to support gold -- the next convention to be held , in Illinois , unanimously supported silver ; the keynote speaker prayed for divine forgiveness for Cleveland 's 1892 nomination . Gold and silver factions in some states , such as Bryan 's Nebraska , sent rival delegations to the convention . <\\/P> <H2> 1896 convention ( edit ) <\\/H2> For a fuller explanation of the procedures of American political conventions , see United States presidential nominating convention . The Chicago Coliseum <P> The 1896 Democratic convention opened at the Chicago Coliseum on July 7 , 1896 . Much activity took place in advance of the formal opening as the silver and ( vastly outnumbered ) gold forces prepared their strategies . Silver forces were supported by the Democratic National Bimetallic Committee , the umbrella group formed in 1895 to support silver Democrats in their insurgency against Cleveland . Gold Democrats looked to the President for leadership , but Cleveland , trusting few in his party , did not involve himself further in the gold efforts , but spent the week of the convention fishing off the New Jersey coast . <\\/P> <P> The Bimetallic Committee carefully planned to take control of every aspect of the convention , eliminating any threat that the minority gold faction could take power . It made no secret of these preparations . This takeover was considered far more important than was the choice of presidential candidate , and the committee decided to take no position on who should win the race for the nomination , reasoning that the victor , no matter who he was , would be a silver man . Well aware of the overwhelming forces against them , many gold delegates were inclined to concede the platform battle . <\\/P> <P> Bryan arrived quietly and took rooms at a modest hotel ; the Nebraskan later calculated that he spent less than $100 while in Chicago . He arrived convinced that he would win the nomination . He had already begun work on a speech . On the evening of July 5 , Bryan was visited by a delegation of Coloradans , seeking his support for Senator Teller . They went away apologetically , not having known Bryan sought the nomination . <\\/P> <H3> Candidates for the nomination ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> Despite the desire of silver delegates to nominate a candidate who shared their beliefs , and although several states instructed their delegates to vote for a specific candidate , there was no overwhelming favorite for the nomination going into the convention . With a two - thirds vote of the delegates needed to nominate , almost every silver delegate would have to vote for the same candidate to assure success , though any organized support from gold delegates would greatly damage a silver candidate 's chances . <\\/P> Former Iowa Governor Horace Boies was a major contender for the Democratic nomination for president in 1896 . <P> The only gold man who put together any sort of campaign for the Democratic nomination was Treasury Secretary John G. Carlisle , but he withdrew in April , stating that he was more concerned about the platform of the party than who would lead it . However , as late as June , the gold forces , which still controlled the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) , continued to believe that the nominee could be pro-gold . Cleveland friend and former Postmaster General Donald M. Dickinson wrote to the President in June 1896 hoping that the delegates would recognize `` common sense '' and be frightened at the thought of nominating a radical . <\\/P> <P> One of the leaders of the silver movement was Illinois Governor Altgeld ; a native of Germany , he was constitutionally barred from the presidency by his foreign birth . Going into the convention , the two leading candidates for the nomination were former Congressman Bland , who had originated the Bland - Allison Act , and former Iowa Governor Horace Boies , with Bland considered the frontrunner . These were the only two candidates to put together organizations to try to secure delegate votes , though both efforts were cash - starved . Both men had electoral problems : Bland at age 61 was seen by some as a man whose time had passed ; Boies was a former Republican who had once decried bimetallism . There were a large number of potential candidates seen as having less support ; these included Vice President Adlai Stevenson of Illinois , Senator Joseph C. Blackburn of Kentucky , Senator Teller , and Bryan . <\\/P> <H3> Silver advocates take control ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> Although Bryan had decided on a strategy to gain the nomination -- to give a speech which would make him the logical candidate in the eyes of delegates -- he faced obstacles along the way . For one thing , he began the 1896 convention without any official status -- the Democratic National Committee , which made the initial determination of which delegations would be seated , had chosen the pro-gold Nebraskans to represent their state . Bryan had been waiting outside the committee room when his rivals were seated by a 27 -- 23 vote ; contemporary accounts state he was `` somewhat surprised '' at the result . The DNC 's action could be reversed , but not until the convention 's credentials committee reported . However , Barnes deemed the actions by the committee immaterial to the outcome due to the silver strength in the convention : <\\/P> <P> Anyone who doubts the power the silverites were ready to unleash in a disciplined and irresistible attack needs only to read the results of the election of temporary chairman . The gold men , though they possessed the machinery of the party , had neither the power nor the strength to challenge their opponents . They could only beg them to spare the party the humiliation of broken traditions and the overthrowing of established control . Nevertheless , Senator John W. Daniel of Virginia was by an overwhelming vote elected temporary chairman , and a Committee on Credentials was appointed that seated Bryan and his contesting Nebraska delegation . <\\/P> We demand the free and unlimited coinage of both silver and gold at the present legal ratio of 16 to 1 without waiting for the aid or consent of any other nation . We demand that the standard silver dollar shall be a full legal tender , equally with gold , for all debts , public and private , and we favor such legislation as will prevent for the future the demonitization of any kind of legal tender by private contract . <P> From the money plank of the Democratic platform <\\/P> <P> Good luck favored Bryan -- he was considered for various convention roles by the silverites , but each time was not selected . The temporary chairmanship , for example , would have permitted him to deliver the keynote address . However , Bryan , lacking a seat at the start of the convention , could not be elected temporary chairman . Bryan considered this no loss at all ; the focus of the convention was on the party platform and the debate which would precede its adoption . The platform would symbolize the repudiation of Cleveland and his policies after the insurgents ' long struggle , and Bryan was determined to close the debate on the platform . Bryan , once seated , was Nebraska 's representative to the Committee on Resolutions ( generally called the `` platform committee '' ) , which allocated 80 minutes to each side in the debate and selected Bryan as one of the speakers . South Carolina Senator Benjamin Tillman was to be the other pro-silver speaker , and originally wished to close the debate . However , the senator wanted 50 minutes to speak , too long for a closing address , and at Bryan 's request agreed to open the debate instead . Accordingly , Bryan became the final speaker on the platform . <\\/P> <P> Delegates , as they waited for the committees to complete their work , spent much of the first two days listening to various orators . Of these , only Senator Blackburn , a silver supporter , sparked much reaction , and that only momentary . Delegates called for better - known speakers , such as Altgeld or Bryan , but were granted neither then ; the Illinois governor declined , and the Nebraskan , once seated , spent much of his time away from the convention floor at the platform committee meeting at the Palmer House . <\\/P> <P> The debate on the platform opened at the start of the third day of the convention , July 9 , 1896 . The session was supposed to begin at 10 : 00 a.m. , but as delegates , slowed by the long commute from the hotels to the Coliseum and fatigue from the first two days , did not arrive on time , proceedings did not begin until 10 : 45 . Nevertheless , large crowds gathered outside the public entrances ; the galleries were quickly packed . Once the convention came to order , Arkansas Senator James K. Jones , chair of the Committee on Resolutions , read the proposed platform to cheers by many delegates ; the reading of the pro-gold minority report attracted less applause . <\\/P> In a 1900 engraving , former Massachusetts Governor William E. Russell is shown preceding Bryan in addressing the convention . <P> `` Pitchfork Ben '' Tillman lived up to his nickname with an incendiary address which began with a reference to his home state 's role in beginning the Civil War . Although Tillman endorsed silver , his address was so laced with sectionalism that most silver delegates remained silent for fear of being seen as supporting him . Tillman 's speech , scheduled to be the only one in support of silver except Bryan 's , was so badly received that Senator Jones , who had not planned to speak , gave a brief address asserting that silver was a national issue . <\\/P> <P> Senator David B. Hill of New York , a gold supporter , was next . As Hill moved to the podium , a reporter friend passed Bryan a note urging him to make a patriotic speech without hint of sectionalism ; Bryan responded , `` You will not be disappointed . '' Hill gave a calm speech defending the gold position , and swayed few delegates . He was followed by two other gold men , Senator William Vilas of Wisconsin and former Massachusetts Governor William E. Russell . Vilas gave a lengthy defense of the Cleveland administration 's policies , so long that Russell , fearing that Vilas ' speech would cut into his time , asked that the time given to the gold proponents be extended by ten minutes . Bryan consented , on condition that his own time was extended by the same amount ; this was agreed to . `` And I needed it for the speech I was to make . '' Bryan later wrote , `` This was another unexpected bit of good fortune . I had never had such an opportunity before in my life and never expect to have again . '' <\\/P> <P> Vilas quickly lost his audience , which did not want to hear Cleveland defended . Russell 's address was inaudible to most of the Coliseum ; he was ill and died just over a week later . As the gold men spoke , Bryan ate a sandwich to settle his stomach ; he was often nervous before major speeches . Another reporter approached him and asked him who he thought would win the nomination . `` Strictly confidential , not to be quoted for publication : I will be . '' <\\/P> <H3> Bryan addresses the convention ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> As Russell concluded , to strong applause from gold delegates , there was a buzz of anticipation as Bryan ascended to the podium . There was loud cheering as Bryan stood there , waiting for his audience to calm . Bryan 's lecture tours had left him a well - known spokesman for silver . As yet , no one at the convention had effectively spoken for that cause , which was paramount to the delegates . According to political scientist Richard F. Bensel in his study of the 1896 Democratic convention , `` Although the silver men knew they would win this fight , they nonetheless needed someone to tell them -- and the gold men -- why they must enshrine silver at the heart of the platform . '' Bensel noted , `` The pump was more than primed , it was ready to explode . '' Bryan would say little that he had not said before -- the text is similar to that of a speech he had given the previous week at Crete , Nebraska -- but he would give the convention its voice . <\\/P> The 1896 Democratic National Convention <P> Bryan began softly , <\\/P> <P> I would be presumptuous , indeed , to present myself against the distinguished gentlemen to whom you have listened if this were a mere measuring of abilities ; but this is not a contest between persons . The humblest citizen in all the land , when clad in the armor of a righteous cause , is stronger than all the hosts of error . I come to speak to you in defense of a cause as holy as the cause of liberty -- the cause of humanity . <\\/P> <P> Bryan 's opening claimed no personal prestige for himself -- but nevertheless placed him as the spokesman for silver . According to Bensel , the self - deprecation helped disarm the delegates . As Bryan was not deemed a major contender for the nomination , even delegates committed to a candidate could cheer him without seeming to betray their allegiance . Bryan then recounted the history of the silver movement ; the audience , which had loudly demonstrated its approval of his opening statements , quieted . Throughout the speech , Bryan had the delegates in the palm of his hand ; they cheered on cue . The Nebraskan later described the audience as like a trained choir . As he concluded his historical recitation , he reminded the silver delegates that they had come to crown their victory , `` not to discuss , not to debate , but to enter up the judgment already rendered by the plain people of this country '' . <\\/P> <P> Bryan continued with language evoking the Civil War , telling his audience that `` in this contest brother has been arrayed against brother , father against son . '' By then , as he spoke in a sincere tone , his voice sounded clearly and loudly through the hall . He denied , however that the contest was personal ; he bore no ill - will towards those who supported the gold standard . However , he stated , facing towards the gold delegates , `` when you come before us and tell us that we are about to disturb your business interests , we reply that you have disturbed our business interests by your course . '' The gold men , during the address , paid close attention and showed their appreciation for Bryan 's oratory . Bryan then defended the right of silver supporters to make their argument against opposition from gold men , who were associated with financial interests , especially in the East . Although his statements nominally responded to a point made by Russell , Bryan had thought of the argument the previous evening , and had not used it in earlier speeches . He always regarded it as the best point he made during the speech , and only the ending caused more reaction from his listeners : <\\/P> <P> We say to you that you have made the definition of a business man too limited in its application . The man who is employed for wages is as much a business man as his employer ; the attorney in a country town is as much a business man as the corporation counsel in a great metropolis ; the merchant at the cross-roads store is as much a business man as the merchant of New York ; the farmer who goes forth in the morning and toils all day , who begins in spring and toils all summer , and who by the application of brain and muscle to the natural resources of the country creates wealth , is as much a business man as the man who goes upon the Board of Trade and bets upon the price of grain ; the miners who go down a thousand feet into the earth , or climb two thousand feet upon the cliffs , and bring forth from their hiding places the precious metals to be poured into the channels of trade are as much business men as the few financial magnates who , in a back room , corner the money of the world . We come to speak of this broader class of business men . <\\/P> <P> Through this passage , Bryan maintained the contrast between the common man and the city - dwelling elite . It was clear to listeners as he worked his way through the comparisons that he would refer to the farmer , and when he did , the hall exploded with sound . His sympathetic comparison contrasted the hardworking farmer with the city businessman , whom Bryan cast as a gambler . The galleries were filled with white as spectators waved handkerchiefs , and it was several minutes before he could continue . The police in the convention hall , not sharing the enthusiasm for silver , were described by the press ( some of whose members were caught up in the frenzy ) as standing as if they thought the audience was about to turn on them . When Bryan resumed , his comparison of miner with miser again electrified the audience ; the uproar prevented him from continuing for several minutes . One farmer in the gallery had been about to leave rather than listen to Bryan , whom he deemed a Populist ; he had been persuaded to stay . At Bryan 's words , he threw his hat into the air , slapped the empty seat in front of him with his coat , and shouted , `` My God ! My God ! My God ! '' <\\/P> <P> Bryan , having established the right of silver supporters to petition , explained why that petition was not to be denied : <\\/P> <P> It is for these that we speak . We do not come as aggressors . Our war is not a war of conquest ; we are fighting in the defense of our homes , our families , and posterity . We have petitioned , and our petitions have been scorned ; we have entreated , and our entreaties have been disregarded ; we have begged , and they have mocked when our calamity came . We beg no longer ; we entreat no more ; we petition no more . We defy them ! <\\/P> <P> With this call to action , Bryan abandoned any hint at compromise , and adopted the techniques of the radical , polarizing orator , finding no common ground between silver and gold forces . He then defended the remainder of the platform , though only speaking in general terms . He mocked McKinley , said by some to resemble Napoleon , noting that he was nominated on the anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo . The lengthy passage as he discussed the platform and the Republicans helped calm the audience , ensuring he would be heard as he reached his peroration . But Bryan first wished to tie the silver question to a greater cause : <\\/P> <P> Upon which side will the Democratic Party fight ; upon the side of `` the idle holders of idle capital '' or upon the side of `` the struggling masses '' ? That is the question which the party must answer first , and then it must be answered by each individual hereafter . The sympathies of the Democratic Party , as shown by the platform , are on the side of the struggling masses , who have ever been the foundation of the Democratic Party . <\\/P> <P> He faced in the direction of the gold - dominated state delegations : <\\/P> <P> There are two ideas of government . There are those who believe that , if you will only legislate to make the well - to - do prosperous , their prosperity will leak through on those below . The Democratic idea , however , has been that if you legislate to make the masses prosperous , their prosperity will find its way up through every class which rests upon them . You come to us and tell us that the great cities are in favor of the gold standard ; we reply that the great cities rest upon our broad and fertile prairies . Burn down your cities and leave our farms , and your cities will spring up again as if by magic ; but destroy our farms and the grass will grow in the streets of every city in the country . <\\/P> <P> This statement attracted great cheering , and Bryan turned to rhetorically demolish the compromise position on bimetallism -- that it should only be accomplished through international agreement : <\\/P> <P> It is the issue of 1776 over again . Our ancestors , when but three millions in number , had the courage to declare their political independence of every other nation ; shall we , their descendants , when we have grown to seventy millions , declare that we are less independent than our forefathers ? No , my friends , that will never be the verdict of our people . Therefore , we care not upon what lines the battle is fought . If they say bimetallism is good , but that we can not have it until other nations help us , we reply that , instead of having a gold standard because England has , we will restore bimetallism , and then let England have bimetallism because the United States has it . If they dare to come out in the open field and defend the gold standard as a good thing , we will fight them to the uttermost . <\\/P> <P> Now , Bryan was ready to conclude the speech , and according to his biographer , Michael Kazin , step `` into the headlines of American history '' . <\\/P> <P> Having behind us the producing masses of this nation and the world , supported by the commercial interests , the laboring interests , and the toilers everywhere , we will answer their demand for a gold standard by saying to them : `` You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns ; you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold . '' <\\/P> <P> As Bryan spoke his final sentence , recalling the Crucifixion of Jesus , he placed his hands to his temples , fingers extended ; with the final words , he extended his arms to his sides straight out to his body and held that pose for about five seconds as if offering himself as sacrifice for the cause , as the audience watched in dead silence . He then lowered them , descended from the podium , and began to head back to his seat as the stillness held . <\\/P> <H2> Reception and nomination ( edit ) <\\/H2> <H3> Convention events ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> Bryan later described the silence as `` really painful '' and momentarily thought he had failed . As he moved towards his seat , the Coliseum burst into pandemonium . Delegates threw hats , coats , and handkerchiefs into the air . Others took up the standards with the state names on them with each delegation , and planted them by Nebraska 's . Two alert police officers had joined Bryan as he left the podium , anticipating the crush . The policemen were swept away by the flood of delegates , who raised Bryan to their shoulders and carried him around the floor . The Washington Post newspaper recorded , `` bedlam broke loose , delirium reigned supreme . '' <\\/P> <P> It took about 25 minutes to restore order , and according to Bensel , `` somewhere in the mass demonstration that was convulsing the convention hall , the transfer of sentiment from silver as a policy to Bryan as a presidential candidate took place '' . Newspaper accounts of the convention leave little doubt but that , had a vote been taken at that moment ( as many were shouting to do ) , Bryan would have been nominated . Bryan was urged by Senator Jones to allow it , but refused , stating that if his boom would not last overnight , it would never last until November . He soon retired from the convention , returning to his hotel to await the outcome . The convention passed the platform in Bryan 's absence and recessed . <\\/P> <P> The balloting began the following morning , July 10 , with a two - thirds vote necessary to nominate . Bryan , who remained at his hotel , sent word to the Nebraska delegation to make no deals on his behalf . He stood second out of fourteen candidates in the first ballot , behind Bland . On the second ballot , Bryan still stood second , but had gained as other candidates had fallen away . The third ballot saw Bland still in the lead , but Bryan took the lead on the fourth ballot . According to Jones , it was clear that Bland could not win , and that Bryan could not be stopped . On the fifth ballot , the Illinois delegation , led by Governor Altgeld , switched its votes from Bland to Bryan . Other delegations , seeing that Bryan would be nominated , also switched , securing the victory . Nevertheless , he won the nomination without the votes of the gold delegates , most of whom either left the convention or refused to vote . <\\/P> <H3> Press reaction ( edit ) <\\/H3> Judge magazine criticized Bryan for sacrilege in his speech . He is shown with crown and cross , but trampling the Bible . <P> Most contemporary press accounts attributed Bryan 's nomination to his eloquence , though in the case of Republican and other gold - favoring newspapers , they considered it his demagoguery . The pro-silver Cleveland Plain Dealer called Bryan 's speech `` an eloquent , stirring , and manly appeal '' . The Chicago Tribune reported that Bryan had lit the spark `` which touched off the trail of gun - powder '' . The St. Louis Post-Dispatch opined that with the speech , Bryan `` just about immortalized himself '' . <\\/P> <P> According to the New York World , `` Lunacy having dictated the platform , it was perhaps natural that hysteria should evolve the candidate . '' The New York Times disparaged Bryan as `` the gifted blatherskite from Nebraska '' . The only paper to predict , after Bryan gave his speech , that he would not be nominated was The Wall Street Journal , which stated , `` Bryan has had his day '' . The Akron Journal and Republican , no friend to Bryan , opined that `` never probably has a national convention been swayed or influenced by a single speech as was the national Democratic convention '' . <\\/P> <H2> Campaign and aftermath ( edit ) <\\/H2> Main article : William Jennings Bryan presidential campaign , 1896 \\u00a7 General election campaign <P> The Pullman Company offered Bryan a private car for his trip home ; he declined , not wishing to accept corporate favors . As he traveled by rail to Lincoln , he saw farmers and others standing by the tracks , hoping for a glimpse of the new Democratic nominee . He received many letters from supporters , expressing their faith in him in stark terms . One Indiana voter wrote , `` God has sent you amongst our people to save the poor from starvation , and we no ( sic ) you will save us . '' A farmer in Iowa , in a letter to Bryan , stated , `` You are the first big man that i ( sic ) ever wrote to . '' <\\/P> Bryan campaigning on stage a few months after the speech <P> When McKinley heard that Bryan was likely to be the nominee , he called the report `` rot '' and hung up the phone . The Republican nominee was slow to realize the surge of support for Bryan after the nomination , stating his view that the silver sentiment would be gone in a month . When McKinley and his advisers , such as industrialist and future senator Mark Hanna , realized that the views were more than transitory , they began intensive fundraising from corporations and the wealthy . The money went for speakers , pamphlets , and other means of conveying their `` sound money '' campaign to the voter . With far less money than McKinley , Bryan embarked on a nationwide campaign tour by train on a then - unprecedented scale . McKinley on the other hand , opted for a front porch campaign . Both men spoke to hundreds of thousands of people from their chosen venues . <\\/P> <P> Bryan 's nomination divided the party . The dissidents nominated their own ticket ; the split in the vote would contribute to Bryan 's defeat . However , Bryan did gain the support of the Populists , as well as a convention of Silver Republicans . Bryan spoke on silver throughout the campaign ; he rarely addressed other issues . Bryan won the South and most of the West , but McKinley 's victories in the more populous Northeast and Midwest carried him to the presidency . The Democratic candidate failed to gain a majority of the labor vote ; McKinley won in working - class areas as well as wealthy precincts . Although McKinley outpolled him by 600,000 votes , Bryan received more votes than any previous presidential candidate . <\\/P> <P> After McKinley 's inauguration , increases in gold availability from new discoveries and improved refining methods led to a considerable increase in the money supply . Even so , in 1900 , Congress passed the Gold Standard Act , formally placing the United States on that standard . Although Bryan ran again on a silver platform in the 1900 presidential election , the issue failed to produce the same resonance with the voters . McKinley won more easily than in 1896 , making inroads in the silver West . <\\/P> <H2> Legacy ( edit ) <\\/H2> A `` Bryan dollar '' issued by his opponents to illustrate the difference between the size of a silver dollar and the amount of bullion that could be purchased with a dollar . <P> Bryan 's speech is considered one of the most powerful political addresses in American history . Stanley Jones , however , suggested that even if Bryan had never delivered it , he would still have been nominated . Jones deemed the Democrats likely to nominate a candidate who would appeal to the Populist Party , and Bryan had been elected to Congress with Populist support . According to rhetorical historian William Harpine in his study of the rhetoric of the 1896 campaign , `` Bryan 's speech cast a net for the true believers , but only for the true believers . '' Harpine suggested that , `` by appealing in such an uncompromising way to the agrarian elements and to the West , Bryan neglected the national audience who would vote in the November election '' . Bryan 's emphasis on agrarian issues , both in his speech and in his candidacy , may have helped cement voting patterns which kept the Democrats largely out of power until the 1930s . <\\/P> <P> Writer Edgar Lee Masters called the speech , `` the beginning of a changed America . '' Bryan 's words gave rise to later economic and political philosophies , including Huey Long 's 1930s Share Our Wealth program , with its trigger phrase , `` Every Man a King '' inspired by Bryan 's speech . Author and political commentator William Safire , in his political dictionary , traced the term `` trickle - down economics '' ( common in the Reagan era ) to Bryan 's statement that some believe that government should legislate for the wealthy , and allow prosperity to `` leak through '' on those below . Historian R. Hal Williams suggested that the opposite philosophy , of legislation for the masses leading to prosperity for all , advocated by Bryan in his speech , informed the domestic policies of later Democratic presidents , including Franklin Roosevelt with his New Deal . <\\/P> <P> Bensel ties the delegates ' response to Bryan 's address to their uncertainty in their own beliefs : <\\/P> <P> In a very real sense , adoption of the silver plank in the platform was akin to a millennial expectation that the `` laws of economics '' would henceforth be suspended and that the silver men could simply `` will '' that silver and gold would , in fact , trade on financial markets at a ratio of sixteen to one . The silver men were thus in the hunt for a charismatic leader who would underpin what they already desperately wanted to believe . They manufactured that leader in the convention , a fabrication in which Bryan was only too happy to assist . <\\/P> <H2> References ( edit ) <\\/H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Kazin , p. 61 . <\\/Li>

Meanwhile , Manny and Ellie are preparing upcoming marriage between Peaches and her fianc\\u00e9 , Julian . Diego and his wife Shira want to start a family , but their fierce appearance tends to scare kids . Sid is dumped by his girlfriend , Francine , just as he is about to propose to her , and he laments his solitude . During Manny and Ellie 's wedding anniversary party , some of the asteroids strike the place and The Herd barely escape . Meanwhile , at the underground lost world , Buck returns a dinosaur egg back to its rightful owner after it was stolen by a trio of flying dromaeosaurs named Gavin , Gertie , and Roger . Buck discovers an ancient stone pillar and takes it to the surface , where he meets Manny and the others . <\\/P> <P> Buck explains to The Herd that according to the pillar , the asteroids had caused several extinctions in the past and with a massive one still incoming , he believes that the only place they could find a clue to stop it is on the site of the impact of the previous ones , as according to its engravings , they always fall at the same place . However , the three dromaeosaurs overhear their conversation , and Gavin and Gertie decide to stop them , believing that they could easily avoid the impact , thus not only getting their revenge on Buck , but also killing all mammals and securing domination over Earth for their species . Roger is reluctant , but Gavin and Gertie strong - arm him into cooperating . <\\/P> <P> As The Herd travels to the crash site , they discover that the asteroids have electro - magnetic properties . Buck theorizes that if a huge quantity of smaller asteroids should be gathered and launched into orbit , they could attract the main asteroid as well and prevent it from falling on Earth . After facing several obstacles and the interference of the dromaeosaurs , The Herd arrives at `` Geotopia '' , a community of immortal animals formed inside one of the asteroids that have fallen long ago , where Sid meets Brooke , a female ground sloth who falls in love with him . However , Shangri Llama , the leader of Geotopia , refuses to cooperate with Buck 's plan to send the city 's crystals into space in order to prevent the imminent impact , as they are the key to the residents ' longevity . Sid inadvertently destroys the entire city when he attempts to remove one of the crystals to present Brooke with , immediately aging them to their real ages and revealing their true crone - like appearances . <\\/P> <P> Once Brooke convinces the Geotopians that preventing the asteroid 's fall is more important than their lost youth , they and The Herd help with Buck 's plan , which is to fill up a geyser with the crystals so that the pressure launches them into space to draw the asteroid away . The dromaeosaurs attempt to intervene , but Buck convinces Roger that they will not be able to survive the asteroid , and he in turn convinces Gavin and Gertie to help . The plan works , and the asteroid is pulled back into space . The Herd then departs back home , including Sid , who parts ways from Brooke , but just after they leave , an asteroid piece falls inside a hot spring , giving it rejuvenating properties and making the Geotopians and Sid 's grandmother , who stayed behind with them , regain their youth . After The Herd returns , Manny reconciles with Julian , Peaches and Julian celebrate their wedding , Diego and Shira become heroes to the kids who were scared of them before , and a rejuvenated Brooke appears during the ceremony to reunite with Sid . <\\/P> <P> In the film 's epilogue , Scrat keeps struggling to control the alien ship until it crashes on Mars , destroying all life on the planet . <\\/P> <P> In a mid-credits scene , Scrat finds his acorn , but gets beaten by some doors . <\\/P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) <\\/H2> Main article : List of Ice Age characters <Ul> <Li> Ray Romano as Manny , a woolly mammoth and the leader of The Herd . <\\/Li> <Li> John Leguizamo as Sid , a ground sloth and the founder of The Herd . <\\/Li> <Li> Denis Leary as Diego , a saber - toothed tiger and the member of The Herd . <\\/Li> <Li> Queen Latifah as Ellie , a female woolly mammoth -- Manny 's wife . <\\/Li> <Li> Simon Pegg as Buck , a one - eyed weasel and a dinosaur - hunter who reunites with The Herd to warn them of the coming asteroid .

As with the third film , which was also inspired by the ice cave scene in which The Herd comes across a dinosaur that was incased in ice , the team went back to the first film to search for a possible inspiration for this next installment . The characters were first hand - drawn on animation software , complete with color and animated clips of the characters doing specific actions . They were then sent to be hand - sculpted with clay , and ultimately scanned into CGI software and animated around the model . <\\/P> <P> The `` Figaro 's Aria '' sequence which involved Buck saving an egg from a trio of dromaeosaurs proved to be one of the most challenging sequences for Blue Sky Studios ' animators , as it involved a continuous uninterrupted shot that ran for around two minutes long . It was one of the first scenes put into production but also one of the last to exit production due to its time - consuming and difficult structure , as the team would only be able to produce three or four seconds of footage a week . <\\/P> <P> The recording session took place in Los Angeles , California since most of the actors live there while the studio is based in New York City . Director Mike Thurmeier and co-director Galen T. Chu would take turns travelling to L.A. to head the recording sessions . In the film , Simon Pegg sang a rendition of `` Figaro '' . Jesse Tyler Ferguson was offered the role after the producers saw his performance in Modern Family . It is his first time working in an animated film . Ferguson blew out his voice on the first day of the recording session because he did a lot of yelling . He then took a few days off and came back later to finish his part . He admitted that he struggled the first time he heard his voice come out of his character 's mouth . As a result , he decided to stop watching interviews of himself on television because he found them to be `` too weird '' . <\\/P> <P> A promotional poster , shown in June 2015 , at the Licensing Expo , revealed the film 's full title : Ice Age : Collision Course . <\\/P> <H2> Soundtrack ( edit ) <\\/H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\\\"2\\\"> Ice Age : Collision Course <\\/Th> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\\\"2\\\"> Film score by John Debney <\\/Th> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Th> Released <\\/Th> <Td> July 19 , 2016 <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Th> Recorded <\\/Th> <Td> <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Th> Genre <\\/Th> <Td> Score <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Th> Label <\\/Th> <Td> Var\\u00e8se Sarabande <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Th> Producer <\\/Th> <Td> John Debney <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\\\"2\\\"> John Debney film scores chronology <\\/Th> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\\\"2\\\"> <Table> <Tr> <Td> Mother 's Day ( 2016 ) <\\/Td> <Td> Ice Age : Collision Course ( 2016 ) <\\/Td> <Td> League of Gods ( 2016 ) <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <\\/Table> <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <\\/Table> <P> The film was composed by John Debney , who replaced John Powell from the previous three films due to Powell being busy with other projects .

The short was included on the film 's home media releases . <\\/P> <P> Following the events of Ice Age : Collision Course , Scrat is heading back to Earth in the saucer . An acorn - shaped ship appears and pulls the acorn , with Scrat holding onto it . In the ship , three alien squirrels ( A.K.A Scratzons ) are surprised by finding Scrat , and blast him away from the acorn . Scrat tries to take it back with a tractor beam in a nearby saucer , but the alien leader pulls it back with another tractor beam . Being pulled to both sides , the nutrogen inside the acorn snaps , creating a massive explosion , which destroys the ship and creates a black hole sucking everything nearby into it .

The site 's critical consensus reads , `` Unoriginal and unfunny , Ice Age : Collision Course offers further proof that not even the healthiest box office receipts can keep a franchise from slouching toward creative extinction . '' Rotten Tomatoes also ranks it as the worst - reviewed film in the Ice Age franchise . On Metacritic , the film has a score of 34 out of 100 based on 27 critics , indicating `` generally unfavorable reviews '' . Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of `` B + '' on an A+ to F scale . <\\/P> <P> Katie Walsh of Los Angeles Times wrote , `` Collision Course is simply a perfunctory , watered - down entry in the series that feels like it should have been released on home video . '' Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film one out of four stars , saying , `` The fifth entry in the Ice Age series is a loud , lazy , laugh - starved cash grab that cynically exploits its target audience ( I use the term advisedly ) by serving them scraps and calling it yummy . '' <\\/P> <P> Owen Gleiberman of Variety wrote , `` The long - running series returns to form with an infectious chatterbox comedy about the end of the world as we know it . '' <\\/P> <H2> Possible sequel ( edit ) <\\/H2> <P> On the possibility of a potential sequel , in June 2016 , Galen T. Chu , co-director of the film , stated that there were some ideas for the sixth installment . In July 2016 , Bustle noted that the potential of Ice Age 6 actually being produced was relatively high even though it could largely depend on the box office performance of the fifth film . PopWrapped commented on the subject of a sequel in February 2017 , pointing out the fifth film 's poor reception and how the franchise was moving further into absurdity and further away from leaving any lasting emotional impact on the audience , and suggesting that the sixth film could `` redeem '' the franchise by going back to its roots and reintroducing the humans from the original film , particularly the little baby named Roshan , and thereby bring the audience to remember why they loved Ice Age so much in the first place , and maybe end the series on a high note . <\\/P> <H2> References ( edit ) <\\/H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Truitt , Brian ( November 5 , 2015 ) . `` Jesse Tyler Ferguson is a limber llama in new ' Ice Age ' '' .

For the first two years of their existence , the club played their home games at the Boston Arena and Boston Garden . With the increasing difficulty of scheduling games at Boston Garden ( owned by the NHL rival Boston Bruins ) , the owners decided to move the team to Hartford , Connecticut , beginning with the 1974 -- 75 season . While waiting for the completion of a new arena in Hartford , the Whalers played the first part of the season at The Big E Coliseum in West Springfield , Massachusetts . On January 11 , 1975 , the team played its first game in front of a sellout crowd at the Hartford Civic Center Coliseum , and would maintain its home there through 1997 . <\\/P> <P> As one of the most stable WHA teams , the Whalers , along with the Edmonton Oilers , Quebec Nordiques and Winnipeg Jets , were admitted to the NHL when the rival leagues merged in 1979 . However , under pressure from the extant NHL team in the New England area , the Boston Bruins , the Whalers were compelled to rename the team the Hartford Whalers . The Whalers were never as successful in the NHL as they had been in the WHA , recording only three winning seasons . They peaked in the mid-to - late 1980s , winning their only playoff series in 1986 over the Nordiques before bowing out in the second round to the Montreal Canadiens , taking the Habs to overtime of Game 7 in the process . The next year , the club secured the regular - season Adams Division title , only to fall to the Nordiques in six games in the first round of the playoffs . In 1992 , the Whalers made the playoffs for the final time , but were bounced in the first round in seven games by the Canadiens . Two years later , the team hired Jim Rutherford as general manager , a position that he would hold within the franchise for twenty years . <\\/P> <P> The organization retains many Whaler connections among its off - ice personnel ; in addition to many members of executive management and the coaching staff , broadcasters Chuck Kaiton , John Forslund and Tripp Tracy ( at the time a minor - league player ) , and equipment managers Wally Tatomir , Skip Cunningham and Bob Gorman all made the move to North Carolina with the team . Finally , the old goal horn from the Hartford Civic Center remains in use at PNC Arena . <\\/P> <H3> Move to North Carolina ( 1997 -- 2001 ) ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> The Whalers were plagued for most of their existence by limited marketability . Hartford was the smallest American market in the league , and was located on the traditional dividing line between the home territories for New York City and Boston teams . It did not help matters that the Hartford Civic Center was one of the smallest arenas in the league , seating just over 15,000 people for hockey . The Whalers ' off - ice problems were magnified when the start of the 1990s triggered a spike in player salaries . <\\/P> In May 1997 , franchise owner Peter Karmanos Jr. announced that the team would move to North Carolina . <P> Despite assurances made when he purchased the team in 1994 that the Whalers would remain in Hartford at least through 1998 , in March 1997 , owner Peter Karmanos announced that the team would move elsewhere after the 1996 -- 97 season because of the team 's inability to negotiate a satisfactory construction and lease package for a new arena in Hartford . On May 6 , 1997 , Karmanos announced that the Whalers would move to the Research Triangle area of North Carolina and the new Entertainment and Sports Arena ( ESA ) in Raleigh . Due to the relatively short time frame for the move , Karmanos himself thought of and decided upon the new name for the club , the Carolina Hurricanes , rather than holding a contest as is sometimes done . Later that summer , the team dropped the Whalers ' colors of blue , green and silver for a new black - and - red scheme , matching the colors of the North Carolina State University Wolfpack , with whose men 's basketball team they would share the arena in Raleigh . The Hurricanes inherited the Whalers ' place in the Northeast Division . <\\/P> <P> Unfortunately for the team , the ESA would not be complete for two more years . The only arena in the Triangle area with an ice plant was 45 - year - old Dorton Arena ; at 5,100 seats , it was completely inadequate even for temporary use . The Hurricanes were thus forced to play home games in Greensboro , 90 minutes west of Raleigh , for their first two seasons after the move . However , the team would be based in Raleigh and practice in nearby Hillsborough -- effectively saddling the Hurricanes with 82 road games for the next two years . This choice was disastrous for the franchise 's attendance and reputation . With a capacity of over 21,000 people for hockey , the Greensboro Coliseum was the highest - capacity arena in the NHL . However , Triangle - area fans balked at making the 80 - mile drive down I - 40 to Greensboro . Likewise , fans from the Piedmont Triad mostly refused to support a lame - duck team that had displaced the popular Greensboro \\/ Carolina Monarchs minor - league franchise . As a result , while the opening game drew a sellout ( and is still the largest home crowd in franchise history ) , most games in Greensboro attracted crowds of 10,000 or fewer . The crowds looked even smaller than that in the cavernous environment . Furthermore , only 29 out of 82 games were televised ( over-the - air and cable combined ) , and radio play - by - play coverage on WPTF was often pre-empted by Wolfpack basketball ( for whose broadcasts WPTF was the flagship station ) , leaving these games totally unavailable to those who did not have a ticket . With by far the smallest season - ticket base in the NHL and attendance figures routinely well below the league average , Sports Illustrated ran a story titled `` Natural Disaster '' , and ESPN anchors mocked the `` Green Acres '' of empty seats ; in a 2006 interview , Karmanos admitted that `` as it turns out , ( Greensboro ) was probably a mistake . '' Under the circumstances , the Hurricanes managed to stay competitive , but still finished last in the Northeast Division with 74 points , nine points out of the playoffs . <\\/P> <P> For 1998 -- 99 , the Hurricanes curtained off most of the upper deck , lowering the Coliseum 's listed capacity to about 12,000 . Attendance continued to lag ; most games attracted crowds of well under 10,000 . On the ice , however , the ' Canes were now out of the doldrums ; led by the return of longtime Whalers captain Ron Francis , Keith Primeau 's 30 goals and Gary Roberts ' 178 penalty minutes , they tallied their first winning season and playoff appearance since 1992 . They also won the new Southeast Division by eight points , only their second division title as an NHL team ( following the 1987 Adams Division title as the Whalers ) . However , tragedy struck hours after the team 's first - round loss to the Bruins , when defenseman Steve Chiasson was thrown from his pickup truck and killed in a single - vehicle drunk - driving accident . <\\/P> <P> Despite their move to the brand - new ESA , the Hurricanes played lackluster hockey in 1999 -- 2000 , failing to make the playoffs . This season was marked by an ultimately franchise - altering mid-season trade which saw Primeau dealt to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for a return including future captain Rod Brind'Amour . In 2000 -- 01 , however , they claimed the eighth seed , nosing out the Boston Bruins , and landed a first - round match - up with the defending champions , the New Jersey Devils . Although the Devils eliminated the Hurricanes in six games , the series is seen as the real `` arrival '' of hockey in the Triangle . Down 3 -- 0 in the series , the Hurricanes extended it to a sixth game , thereby becoming only the tenth team in NHL history to do so . Game 6 in Raleigh featured their best playoff crowd that year , as well as their loudest . Despite the 5 -- 1 loss , Carolina was given a standing ovation by their home crowd as the game ended , erasing some of the doubts that the city would not warm up to the team . <\\/P> <H3> Stanley Cup Finals and slow starts ( 2001 -- 2006 ) ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> The Hurricanes made national waves for the first time in the 2002 playoffs . They survived a late charge from the Washington Capitals to win the division , but expectations were low entering the first round against the defending Eastern Conference champion New Jersey Devils . However , Art\\u016brs Irbe and Kevin Weekes were solid in goal , and the Hurricanes won two games in overtime as they defeated the Devils in six games . Their second - round matchup was against the Montreal Canadiens , who were riding a wave of emotion after their captain Saku Koivu 's return from cancer treatment . In the third period of Game 4 in Montreal , down 2 -- 1 in the series and 3 -- 0 in the game , Carolina would tie the game and then win on Niclas Wallin 's overtime goal . The game became known to Hurricanes fans as the `` Miracle at Molson '' ; Carolina won the next two games by a combined 13 -- 3 margin over a dejected Habs club to take the series . <\\/P> <P> In the Eastern Conference Finals , Carolina met the heavily favored Toronto Maple Leafs . In Game 6 in Toronto , the Leafs ' Mats Sundin tied the game with 22 seconds remaining to send it to overtime , where Carolina 's Martin Gelinas would score to send the franchise to their first Stanley Cup Finals appearance . During this series , several Hurricanes fan traditions drew hockey - wide media attention for the first time : fans met the team at the airport on the return from every road trip , and echoed football - season habits honed for games across the parking lot by hosting massive tailgate parties before each home game , a relative novelty in the cold - weather - centric NHL . Inside the building , the CBC 's Don Cherry lauded the RBC Center as `` the loudest building in the NHL '' , praise that would be echoed in 2006 . <\\/P> <P> In the Stanley Cup Finals , Carolina would face the Detroit Red Wings , thought to be the prohibitive favorite all year . Though the ' Canes stunned the Wings in Game 1 , when Ron Francis scored in the first minute of overtime , Detroit stormed back to win the next four games . Game 3 in Raleigh featured a triple - overtime thriller eventually won by Detroit 's Igor Larionov , the oldest player to score a last - round goal . <\\/P> Eric Staal was drafted by the Hurricanes in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft . He was later named team captain in 2010 . <P> The Hurricanes looked poised to pick up where they left off in 2002 -- 03 , but never recovered from a 10 - loss January and finished dead last in the league with 61 points . After a similarly slow start to the 2003 -- 04 season , Paul Maurice , who had been the team 's coach since midway through their next - to - last season in Hartford , was fired and replaced with former New York Islanders bench boss Peter Laviolette . Under Laviolette , Weekes remained tough , but the offense was suspect ; center Josef Vasicek led the team with a mere 19 goals and 26 assists for 45 points . Many of the new fans attracted to the team ( and to hockey itself ) during the 2002 playoff run lost interest and attendance declined . One of the few positive results of these losing years , however , was the team 's drafting of future star Eric Staal in 2003 . <\\/P> Stanley Cup champions ( edit ) <P> The outcome of the 2004 -- 05 NHL lockout led to the shrinking of the payroll to $26 million . The Hurricanes , however , turned out to be one of the NHL 's biggest surprises , turning in the best season in the franchise 's 34 - year history . They finished the regular season with a 52 -- 22 -- 8 record and 112 points , shattering the previous franchise records of 94 points ( in the WHA ) set by the 1972 -- 73 Whalers and 93 points ( in the NHL ) set in 1986 -- 87 . It was the first time ever that the franchise had passed the 50 - win and 100 - point plateaus . The 112 - point figure was good for fourth overall in the league , easily their highest overall finish as an NHL team ( tied with the third - overall Dallas Stars in points , but with one fewer win than the Stars ) and second in the East ( one point behind the Ottawa Senators ) . The Hurricanes also ran away with their third Southeast Division title , finishing 20 points ahead of the Tampa Bay Lightning . Attendance increased from 2003 -- 04 , averaging just under 15,600 per game , and the team made a profit for the first time since the move from Hartford . <\\/P> <P> In the playoffs , after losing the first two games of the conference quarterfinal series against the Montreal Canadiens , Laviolette lifted goalkeeper Martin Gerber -- who had been struggling to regain his form after playing through a bout of intestinal flu -- in favor of rookie Cam Ward . The Hurricanes went on to win both games in Montreal , tying up the playoff series and turning the momentum around , winning the series on a Game 6 overtime goal by Cory Stillman . Carolina then faced the New Jersey Devils in the conference semi-finals , which proved surprisingly one - sided , as the Hurricanes beat the Devils in five games . Stillman struck again , once again scoring the series - winning goal . <\\/P> <P> In the Eastern Conference Finals , the Hurricanes faced the Buffalo Sabres , who had finished just one spot behind the Hurricanes in the overall standings . The contentious series saw both coaches -- Lindy Ruff and Laviolette -- taking public verbal shots at each other 's team , but in the deciding Game 7 , the Hurricanes rallied with three goals in the third to win by a score of 4 -- 2 . Rod Brind'Amour scored the game winner as the Hurricanes reached the Stanley Cup finals for the second time in team history . <\\/P> The Hurricanes celebrate following their game seven victory in the 2006 Stanley Cup Finals . <P> The Stanley Cup Finals were against the Edmonton Oilers , the first time in NHL history that two former WHA franchises had played against one another in the finals . The Hurricanes rallied from a 3 -- 0 deficit in Game 1 to win 5 -- 4 after Rod Brind'Amour scored with 30 seconds left . In Game 2 , the Hurricanes shelled the Oilers 5 -- 0 to take a two - game lead . The Oilers won Game 3 in Edmonton , 2 -- 1 , as Ryan Smyth scored the game - winning goal with 2 : 47 left to play . Carolina rebounded in Game 4 with a 2 -- 1 victory , and came home with a chance to win the Cup on home ice . However , Game 5 saw the Oilers come back with a stunning 4 -- 3 overtime win on a shorthanded breakaway by Fernando Pisani . In Game 6 in Edmonton , Carolina was soundly defeated 4 -- 0 ; the only bright point for the Hurricanes was the return of forward Erik Cole from a broken neck that had sidelined him since March . In Game 7 , before the second - largest home crowd in franchise history ( 18,978 ) , the Hurricanes won 3 -- 1 , sealing the Hurricanes ' first Stanley Cup championship in franchise history . Ward was honored with the Conn Smythe Trophy for the playoffs ' most valuable player , becoming just the fourth rookie to be honored with the award . Several Hurricanes raised the Cup for the first time in their long NHL careers ; Rod Brind'Amour and Bret Hedican had both played over 15 years without winning the Cup , while Glen Wesley -- the last remaining Hartford Whaler on the Hurricanes ' roster -- had waited 18 seasons . On the managerial side , general manager Jim Rutherford finally won the Cup in his twelfth year with the franchise since joining the Whalers in 1994 . <\\/P> <P> The Hurricanes Stanley Cup championship marked the first professional major league sports title for a team from North Carolina . As well , they were the first NHL team to win the Stanley Cup despite losing at least nine playoff games in that year ; the 2011 Boston Bruins , the 2014 Los Angeles Kings , and the 2017 Pittsburgh Penguins are the only other teams to have accomplished the feat . <\\/P> <H3> Post-championship slump ( 2006 -- 2017 ) ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> The Hurricanes were unable to follow up their success . Losing four players to free agency in the offseason and 222 - man games to injury during 2006 -- 07 , the team struggled throughout the regular season , and once eliminated in the last game , the Hurricanes finished third in the Southeast and 11th overall in the Eastern Conference . This finish made them the first champions since the 1938 -- 39 Chicago Black Hawks to have failed to qualify for the playoffs both the seasons before and after their championship season , and the third champion overall to not defend its title after both the Black Hawks and the 1995 - 96 New Jersey Devils . In 2007 -- 08 , Carolina again missed out as Washington Capitals stormed back to take the division title on the last day of the season , leaving the Hurricanes second in the division and ninth overall in the conference , and making the ' Canes only the second club in NHL history to miss the playoffs for two seasons running after a Cup triumph . <\\/P> In 2009 the Hurricanes acquired Jussi Jokinen through a trade with the Tampa Bay Lightning . <P> After a slow start to the 2008 -- 09 season , Cup - winning coach Peter Laviolette was fired in early December and replaced by his own predecessor , Paul Maurice . Teetering on the edge of the playoff picture again , the club , on February 7 , acquired utility forward Jussi Jokinen from the Tampa Bay Lightning in exchange for Wade Brookbank , Josef Melichar and Carolina 's fourth round draft pick in 2009 , then reacquired winger Erik Cole from the Edmonton Oilers at the March trade deadline and proceeded on a 12 -- 3 -- 2 run to close out the season . The stretch run included nine straight wins , matching a franchise record from the 2005 -- 06 season , and capped off a streak of 12 straight home wins , which set a new franchise mark . The team finished sixth in the Eastern Conference with 97 points , the second-most points in franchise history . <\\/P> <P> The Canes ' 2009 playoff run featured two tight series with dramatic finishes . Game 4 of the first round matchup with the New Jersey Devils saw Stanley Cup playoff history when Jussi Jokinen scored with . 2 seconds left in regulation to win the game , the latest regulation game - winning goal in NHL history . Then , in Game 7 , the Devils took a 3 -- 2 lead into the final two minutes of the game at the Prudential Center in Newark before the ' Canes struck . With 1 : 20 to play , Tim Gleason saved a puck on his knees at the right point , passed it to Joni Pitkanen on the left boards , who then hit Game 4 hero Jussi Jokinen at the far post for the tying goal . Just 48 seconds later , Chad LaRose sprang Eric Staal for a solo down - ice rush to give the Canes 4 -- 3 game and series wins ; Staal 's goal was the latest regulation Game 7 winning goal in playoff history . In the second round matchup with the top - seeded Boston Bruins , the ' Canes ran out to a 3 -- 1 lead before the Bruins battled back for two wins . In Game 7 in Boston , Scott Walker scored the game and series winner 18 : 46 into overtime to send Carolina to the Eastern Conference finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins . The Penguins , though , put a decisive end to the ' Canes ' string , sweeping the series 4 -- 0 on the way to their own Stanley Cup championship . <\\/P> <P> As a result of their surprise run , very few changes were made in the off - season . Veterans such as Aaron Ward , Andrew Alberts and Stephane Yelle were brought in to help drive the team further , but things did not go according to plan . The Hurricanes experienced a 14 - game losing streak spanning October and November , and midway through the year , the ' Canes replaced their only post-lockout captain Rod Brind'Amour with Eric Staal . Despite improved play during the second half of the season , they could not overcome the deficit from early on in the season . The Hurricanes would end up with the seventh overall pick in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft , eventually selecting Jeff Skinner from the Kitchener Rangers of the Ontario Hockey League ( OHL ) . Brind'Amour retired over the 2010 off - season to take a coaching job with the club . <\\/P> Jeff Skinner was awarded the Calder Memorial Trophy for his rookie season performance in the 2010 -- 11 season . <P> The 2010 -- 11 - year was widely expected to be a transitional year from the veteran - heavy , high - salary club that opened 2009 -- 10 to a younger , cheaper base . The ' Canes , though , contended for a playoff slot for the entire season , aided by Skinner 's emergence as an offensive phenomenon who , as the youngest player in the league , would lead all rookies in points . Raleigh hosted the 2011 NHL All - Star Game in January , and Eric Staal captained a team he selected ( opposite a team selected by the Detroit Red Wings ' Nicklas Lidstrom ) that featured Skinner ( the youngest All - Star in NHL history ) , Cam Ward , and ( for the SuperSkills competition ) defenseman Jamie McBain . The Hurricanes went into the final day of the season able to determine their own fate , but lost 6 -- 2 to the Tampa Bay Lightning to finish ninth in the East . Skinner was awarded the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year , the first player in franchise history to receive that honor . <\\/P> <P> In December 2011 , the Carolina Hurricanes fired coach Paul Maurice and hired Kirk Muller . On February 20 , 2012 , the Carolina Hurricanes signed Tim Gleason to a four - year , $16 million extension and two days later , on February 22 , they also signed Tuomo Ruutu to a four - year , $19 million extension . Two months later the Carolina Hurricanes announced that they had signed Jiri Tlusty to a two - year deal that would pay him $1.5 million for 2012 -- 13 and $1.7 million for 2013 -- 14 ( Gleason and Tlusty would eventually be traded to the Washington Capitals and the Winnipeg Jets over the next few seasons ) . Despite the signings of Gleason , Ruutu , and Tlusty , the Hurricanes would finish fifth in the Southeast Division and twelfth in the Eastern Conference during the 2011 -- 12 season , which forced them to miss the playoffs for a third consecutive season . <\\/P> <P> On May 9 , 2012 , the 2006 Stanley Cup Champions Carolina Hurricanes ' Game 7 victory was recognized as one of the NC Hall of Fame 's `` Great Moments '' series . During the 2012 NHL Entry Draft , the Carolina Hurricanes traded Brandon Sutter , Brian Dumoulin and their 2012 first round draft pick ( Derrick Pouliot ) to the Penguins in exchange for Jordan Staal , uniting the player with his older brother , Eric Staal . On March 25 , 2013 , the Hurricanes signed Alexander Semin to a five - year deal , worth $35 million . However , in the lockout - shortened 2012 -- 13 season , the team would finish third in the Southeast Division and thirteenth in the Eastern Conference , which would make the team miss the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season . <\\/P> Bill Peters was named the head coach of the Hurricanes in June 2014 . He maintained the position until his resignation in April 2018 . <P> Before the 2013 -- 14 season , the Hurricanes were realigned into the new Metropolitan Division . They would finish seventh in the division during the 2013 -- 14 season ( ahead of only the New York Islanders ) and would miss the playoffs for the fifth consecutive season , which prompted management to fire head coach Kirk Muller . In addition , longtime general manager Jim Rutherford was promoted to an advisory role after the season , with longtime Hurricanes star Ron Francis announced as his replacement on April 28 , 2014 . On June 19 , 2014 , Bill Peters was named head coach of the team . During the 2014 -- 15 season , the team finished last in the Metropolitan Division and would miss the playoffs for the sixth consecutive season . After team captain Eric Staal was traded to the New York Rangers at the trade deadline , the team finished sixth in the division during the 2015 -- 16 season . The Hurricanes finished seventh in the division in the 2016 -- 17 season , missing the playoffs for the eighth consecutive season . <\\/P> <H3> Tom Dundon era ( 2018 -- present ) ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> Before the 2017 -- 18 season , the Hurricanes unveiled new uniforms . On July 13 , 2017 , it was reported that Chuck Greenberg had sent Karmanos a letter of intent to buy the team for $500 million . On December 7 , 2017 , it was announced that Thomas Dundon signed an agreement to purchase the Hurricanes , which ensured that the team would not be relocated . The deal was finalized on January 11 , 2018 , with Dundon becoming majority owner and having a 61 percent stake in the team , while Karmanos retained a minority interest . <\\/P> <P> Dundon wasted little time in overhauling the Hurricanes ' front office . On March 8 , 2018 , the team announced that general manager Ron Francis had been moved to the role of president of hockey operations `` ; however , Sportsnet reporter Elliotte Friedman reported that the `` promotion '' was likely in name only , noting that `` there were rumblings Francis \\/ Dundon did not see eye - to - eye . '' Subsequently , coach Bill Peters resigned from his position on April 20 , 2018 to pursue a similar opportunity with the Calgary Flames ( he ultimately replaced Glen Gulutzan as the Flames ' head coach three days later ) , and the Hurricanes officially fired Francis from the organization altogether on April 30 , 2018 , leaving vacancies in both the head coach and general manager positions . <\\/P> <P> Early in the Hurricanes ' search for a replacement general manager , it was reported that Dundon 's salary offerings for the position could be prohibitive in attracting quality candidates . Sportsnet 's Nick Kypreos reported that the Hurricanes were offering `` in the ballpark of $400,000 a year '' , a fraction of the salary figures of many other teams ' coaches , let alone those of their general managers , who serve in a higher - ranking position . Leading up to Kypreos ' report , candidates such as Nashville Predators assistant general manager Paul Fenton , New Jersey Devils assistant general manager Tom Fitzgerald , and Los Angeles Kings assistant general manager Mike Futa had all reportedly passed on the position . <\\/P> <P> Ultimately , on May 8 , 2018 , the Hurricanes announced the hiring of former Atlanta Thrashers general manager Don Waddell as team president and general manager . Waddell had previously been serving as the team 's interim general manager since the promotion of Francis . At the same time , it was announced that former team captain Rod Brind'Amour had been named head coach , after having served on the team 's coaching staff as an assistant coach since 2011 . <\\/P> <H2> Minor league affiliates ( edit ) <\\/H2> <Ul> <Li> 1979 -- 1980 : Springfield Indians <\\/Li> <Li> 1980 -- 1990 : Binghamton Whalers <\\/Li> <Li> 1990 -- 1994 : Springfield Indians <\\/Li> <Li> 1994 -- 1997 : Springfield Falcons <\\/Li> <Li> 1997 -- 1999 : Beast of New Haven <\\/Li> <Li> 1999 -- 2001 : Cincinnati Cyclones <\\/Li> <Li> 2001 -- 2006 : Lowell Lock Monsters <\\/Li> <Li> 2006 -- 2010 : Albany River Rats <\\/Li> <Li> 2010 -- present : Charlotte Checkers <\\/Li> <\\/Ul> <H2> Season - by - season record ( edit ) <\\/H2> <P> This is a list of the last five seasons completed by the Hurricanes .

Often , the two processes consist of an implicit ( automatic ) , unconscious process and an explicit ( controlled ) , conscious process . Verbalized explicit processes or attitudes and actions may change with persuasion or education ; though implicit process or attitudes usually take a long amount of time to change with the forming of new habits . Dual process theories can be found in social , personality , cognitive , and clinical psychology .

He believed that there were two different kinds of thinking : associative and true reasoning . James theorized that empirical thought was used for things like art and design work . For James , images and thoughts would come to mind of past experiences , providing ideas of comparison or abstractions . He claimed that associative knowledge was only from past experiences describing it as `` only reproductive '' . James believed that true reasoning was useful for `` unprecedented situations '' in which using reasoning to overcome obstacles such as navigation could be overcome with reasoning power of being able to use a map . <\\/P> <P> There are various dual process theories that were produced after William James 's work . Dual process models are very common in the study of social psychological variables , such as attitude change . Examples include Petty and Cacioppo 's elaboration likelihood model explained briefly below and Chaiken 's heuristic systematic model . According to these models , persuasion may occur after either intense scrutiny or extremely superficial thinking . In cognitive psychology , attention and working memory have also been conceptualized as relying on two distinct processes . Whether the focus be on social psychology or cognitive psychology , there are many examples of dual process theories produced throughout the past . The following just show a glimpse into the variety that can be found . <\\/P> <P> Jonathan Evans suggested dual process theory in 1975 . In his theory , there are two distinct types of processes : heuristic processes and analytic processes . He suggested that during heuristic processes , an individual chooses which information is relevant to the current situation . Relevant information is then processed further whereas irrelevant information is not . Following the heuristic processes come analytic processes . During analytic processes , the relevant information that is chosen during the heuristic processes is then used to make judgments about the situation . <\\/P> <P> Richard E. Petty and John Cacioppo proposed a dual process theory focused in the field of social psychology in 1986 . Their theory is called the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion . In their theory , there are two different routes to persuasion in making decisions . The first route is known as the central route and this takes place when a person is thinking carefully about a situation , elaborating on the information they are given , and creating an argument . This route occurs when an individual 's motivation and ability are high . The second route is known as the peripheral route and this takes place when a person is not thinking carefully about a situation and uses shortcuts to make judgments . This route occurs when an individual 's motivation or ability are low . <\\/P> <P> Steven Sloman produced another interpretation on dual processing in 1996 . He believed that associative reasoning takes stimuli and divides it into logical clusters of information based on statistical regularity . He proposed that how you associate is directly proportional to the similarity of past experiences , relying on temporal and similarity relations to determine reasoning rather than an underlying mechanical structure . The other reasoning process in Sloman 's opinion was of the Rule - based system . The system functioned on logical structure and variables based upon rule systems to come to conclusions different from that of the associative system . He also believed that the Rule - based system had control over the associative system , though it could only suppress it . This interpretation corresponds well to earlier work on computational models of dual processes of reasoning . <\\/P> <P> Daniel Kahneman provided further interpretation by differentiating the two styles of processing more , calling them intuition and reasoning in 2003 . Intuition ( or system 1 ) , similar to associative reasoning , was determined to be fast and automatic , usually with strong emotional bonds included in the reasoning process . Kahneman said that this kind of reasoning was based on formed habits and very difficult to change or manipulate . Reasoning ( or system 2 ) was slower and much more volatile , being subject to conscious judgments and attitudes . <\\/P> <P> Fritz Strack and Roland Deutsch proposed another dual process theory focused in the field of social psychology in 2004 . According to their model , there are two separate systems : the reflective system and the impulsive system . In the reflective system , decisions are made using knowledge and the information that is coming in from the situation is processed . On the other hand , in the impulsive system , decisions are made using schemes and there is little or no thought required . <\\/P> <H2> Theories ( edit ) <\\/H2> <H3> Dual process learning model ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> Ron Sun proposed a dual process model of learning ( both implicit learning and explicit learning ) . The model ( named CLARION ) re-interpreted voluminous behavioral data in psychological studies of implicit learning and skill acquisition in general . The resulting theory is two - level and interactive , based on the idea of the interaction of one - shot explicit rule learning ( i.e. , explicit learning ) and gradual implicit tuning through reinforcement ( i.e. implicit learning ) , and it accounts for many previously unexplained cognitive data and phenomena based on the interaction of implicit and explicit learning . <\\/P> <H3> Dual coding ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> Using a somewhat different approach , Allan Paivio has developed a dual - coding theory of information processing . According to this model , cognition involves the coordinated activity of two independent , but connected systems , a nonverbal system and a verbal system that is specialized to deal with language . The nonverbal system is hypothesized to have developed earlier in evolution . Both systems rely on different areas of the brain . Paivio has reported evidence that nonverbal , visual images are processed more efficiently and are approximately twice as memorable . Additionally , the verbal and nonverbal systems are additive , so one can improve memory by using both types of information during learning . <\\/P> <H3> Dual - process accounts of reasoning ( edit ) <\\/H3> Background ( edit ) <P> The dual - process accounts of reasoning posits that there are two systems or minds in one brain . The theory of two distinct kinds of reasoning has been around for as long as documentations about theories of reasoning go . The current theory is that there are two distinctively separate cognitive systems underlying thinking and reasoning and that these different systems were developed through evolution . These systems are often referred to as `` implicit '' and `` explicit '' or by the more neutral `` System 1 '' and `` System 2 , '' as coined by Stanovich and West . <\\/P> Systems ( edit ) <P> The systems have multiple names by which they can be called , as well as many different properties . <\\/P> <P> Differences between System 1 and System 2 <\\/P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> System 1 <\\/Th> <Th> System 2 <\\/Th> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Unconscious reasoning <\\/Td> <Td> Conscious reasoning <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Mostly involuntary <\\/Td> <Td> Mostly voluntary <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Mostly linked to emotions ( `` gut feeling '' ) <\\/Td> <Td> Mostly detached from emotions <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Implicit <\\/Td> <Td> Explicit <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Automatic <\\/Td> <Td> Controlled <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Low Effort <\\/Td> <Td> High Effort <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Large Capacity <\\/Td> <Td> Small Capacity <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Rapid <\\/Td> <Td> Slow <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Default process ( suppressed by System 2 , intense concentration ) <\\/Td> <Td> Inhibitory ( suppressed by clearing mind , meditation ) <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Association ( A \\u2194 B ) <\\/Td> <Td> Implication ( A \\u2192 B ) <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Contextualized <\\/Td> <Td> Abstract <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Domain - specific <\\/Td> <Td> Domain - general <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> More subjective , Value - based <\\/Td> <Td> More objective , Fact \\/ Rule - based <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Evolutionarily old <\\/Td> <Td> Evolutionarily recent <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Nonverbal <\\/Td> <Td> Linked to language <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Includes recognition , perception , orientation . <\\/Td> <Td> Includes rule following , comparisons , weighing of options . <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Modular Cognition <\\/Td> <Td> Fluid Intelligence <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Independent of working memory . <\\/Td> <Td> Limited by working memory capacity . <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Intuitive , Creative <\\/Td> <Td> Logical , Rational <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Metaphorical , Figurative <\\/Td> <Td> Literal , Exact <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> More qualitative <\\/Td> <Td> More quantitative <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Artistic , Aesthetic design <\\/Td> <Td> Scientific , Mathematical , Technical , Formal <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Imaginative <\\/Td> <Td> Realistic <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Daydreaming , Mind wandering <\\/Td> <Td> Working , Paying attention <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Insightful ( Aha moments ) , Radical , Novel <\\/Td> <Td> Methodical , Incremental , Repetitive <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Parallel , Simultaneous , Nonlinear <\\/Td> <Td> Serial , Sequential , Linear <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Top - down , Holistic , Big picture <\\/Td> <Td> Bottom - up , Elemental , Detail - oriented <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Scope , Scale , Context <\\/Td> <Td> Purpose , Objectives , Requirements <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Open - ended , Adaptable <\\/Td> <Td> Closed - ended , Rigid <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Integrative and Separative <\\/Td> <Td> Selective , Discriminative <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Meta , Reflective <\\/Td> <Td> Iterative , Recursive <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Generates ( builds up and breaks down ) and recognizes patterns , concepts , and ideas . <\\/Td> <Td> Manipulates , filters , and uses patterns , concepts , and ideas . <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Processes Data \\u2194 Information . <\\/Td> <Td> Processes Data \\u2192 Data and Information \\u2192 Information . <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Searches and finds possibilities . <\\/Td> <Td> Examines and executes goals . <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Works across multiple levels of abstraction simultaneously . <\\/Td> <Td> Works within a single level of abstraction at a given time . <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Synthesis ( Bloom 's ) <\\/Td> <Td> Analysis ( Bloom 's ) <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Intuition ( Myers - Briggs ) <\\/Td> <Td> Thinking ( Myers - Briggs ) <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Genius <\\/Td> <Td> Expertise <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> `` Right brain '' , `` Lateral thinking '' <\\/Td> <Td> `` Left brain '' , `` Vertical thinking '' <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Default mode network ( Neuroscience ) <\\/Td> <Td> Task - positive network ( Neuroscience ) <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Connectionism ( Cognitive science ) <\\/Td> <Td> Computationalism ( Cognitive science ) <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Neural networks <\\/Td> <Td> ( Can be compared to ) Digital logic <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Difficult to measure with tests .

One way for a process to be labeled as automatic is for the person to be unaware of it . There are three ways in which a person may be unaware of a mental process : they can be unaware of the presence of the stimulus ( subliminal ) , how the stimulus is categorized or interpreted ( unaware of the activation of stereotype or trait constructs ) , or the effect the stimulus has on the person 's judgments or actions ( misattribution ) . Another way for a mental process to be labeled as automatic is for it to be unintentional . Intentionality refers to the conscious `` start up '' of a process . An automatic process may begin without the person consciously willing it to start . The third component of automaticity is efficiency . Efficiency refers to the amount of cognitive resources required for a process . An automatic process is efficient because it requires few resources . The fourth component is controllability , referring to the person 's conscious ability to stop a process . An automatic process is uncontrollable , meaning that the process will run until completion and the person will not be able to stop it . Bargh ( 1994 ) conceptualizes automaticity as a component view ( any combination awareness , intention , efficiency , and control ) as opposed to the historical concept of automaticity as an all - or - none dichotomy . <\\/P> <P> One takeaway from the psychological research on dual process theory is that our System 1 ( intuition ) is more accurate in areas where we 've gathered a lot of data with reliable and fast feedback , like social dynamics . <\\/P> System 2 in humans ( edit ) <P> System 2 is evolutionarily recent and specific to humans . It is also known as the explicit system , the rule - based system , the rational system , or the analytic system . It performs the more slow and sequential thinking . It is domain - general , performed in the central working memory system . Because of this , it has a limited capacity and is slower than System 1 which correlates it with general intelligence . It is known as the rational system because it reasons according to logical standards . Some overall properties associated with System 2 are that it is rule - based , analytic , controlled , demanding of cognitive capacity , and slow . <\\/P> <H2> Social Psychology ( edit ) <\\/H2> <P> The dual process has impact on social psychology in such domains as stereotyping , categorization , and judgment . Especially , the study of automaticity and of implicit in dual process theories has the most influence on a person 's perception . People usually perceive other people 's information and categorize them by age , gender , race , or role . According to Neuberg and Fiske ( 1987 ) a perceiver who receives a good amount of information about the target person then will use their formal mental category ( Unconscious ) as a basis for judging the person . When the perceiver is distracted , the perceiver has to pay more attention to target information ( Conscious ) . Categorization is the basic process of stereotyping in which people are categorized into social groups that have specific stereotypes associated with them . It is able to retrieve people 's judgment automatically without subjective intention or effort . Attitude can also be activated spontaneously by the object . John Bargh 's study offered an alternative view , holding that essentially all attitudes , even weak ones are capable of automatic activation . Whether the attitude is formed automatically or operates with effort and control , it can still bias further processing of information about the object and direct the perceivers ' actions with regard to the target . According to Shelly Chaiken , heuristic processing is the activation and application of judgmental rules and heuristics are presumed to be learned and stored in memory . It is used when people are making accessible decisions such as `` experts are always right '' ( system 1 ) and systematic processing is inactive when individuals make effortful scrutiny of all the relevant information which requires cognitive thinking ( system 2 ) . The heuristic and systematic processing then influence the domain of attitude change and social influence . Unconscious thought theory is the counterintuitive and contested view that the unconscious mind is adapted to highly complex decision making . Where most dual system models define complex reasoning as the domain of effortful conscious thought , UTT argues complex issues are best dealt with unconsciously . <\\/P> <H3> Stereotyping ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> Dual process models of stereotyping propose that when we perceive an individual , salient stereotypes pertaining to them are activated automatically . These activated representations will then guide behavior if no other motivation or cognition take place . However , controlled cognitive processes can inhibit the use of stereotypes when there is motivation and cognitive resources to do so . Devine ( 1989 ) provided evidence for the dual process theory of stereotyping in a series of three studies . Study 1 linked found prejudice ( according to the Modern Racism Scale ) was unrelated to knowledge of cultural stereotypes of African Americans . Study 2 showed that subjects used automatically - activated stereotypes in judgments regardless of prejudice level ( personal belief ) . Participants were primed with stereotype relevant or non-relevant words and then asked to give hostility ratings of a target with an unspecified race who was performing ambiguously hostile behaviors . Regardless of prejudice level , participants who were primed with more stereotype - relevant words gave higher hostility ratings to the ambiguous target . Study 3 investigated whether people can control stereotype use by activating personal beliefs . Low - prejudice participants asked to list African Americans listed more positive examples than did those high in prejudice . <\\/P> <H3> Terror management theory and the dual process model ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> According to psychologists Pyszczynski , Greenberg , & Solomon , the dual process model , in relation to terror management theory , identifies two systems by which the brain manages fear of death : distal and proximal . Distal defenses fall under the system 1 category because it is unconscious whereas proximal defenses fall under the system 2 category because it operates with conscious thought . <\\/P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Distal defenses <\\/Th> <Th> Proximal defenses <\\/Th> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Deal with subconscious , abstract ideas of death <\\/Td> <Td> Deal with conscious thoughts of death at the level of a specific threat <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Experiential <\\/Td> <Td> Rational <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Occur when mortality is not salient <\\/Td> <Td> Occur immediately after direct reminder or threat of mortality <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Occur in response to subliminal reminders of death <\\/Td> <Td> Does not occur after subliminal reminders of death <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> Operate by self - conception as a part of a death - transcendent reality ( i.e. thinking of oneself as part of a culture that will endure beyond one 's own life ) . <\\/Td> <Td> Operate by pushing thoughts of death into the distant future and removing them from conscious thought <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <\\/Table> <H3> Dual process and habituation ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> Habituation can be described as decreased response to a repeated stimulus . According to Groves and Thompson , the process of habituation also mimics a dual process . The dual process theory of behavioral habituation relies on two underlying ( non-behavioral ) processes ; depression and facilitation with the relative strength of one over the other determining whether or not habituation or sensitization is seen in the behavior . Habituation weakens the intensity of a repeated stimulus over time subconsciously . As a result , a person will give the stimulus less conscious attention over time . Conversely , sensitization subconsciously strengthens a stimulus over time , giving the stimulus more conscious attention . Though these two systems are not both conscious , they interact to help people understand their surroundings by strengthening some stimuli and diminishing others . <\\/P> <H3> Dual process and steering cognition ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> According to Walker , system 1 functions as a serial cognitive steering processor for system 2 , rather than a parallel system . In large - scale repeated studies with school students , Walker tested how students adjusted their imagined self - operation in different curriculum subjects of maths , science and English . He showed that students consistently adjust the biases of their heuristic self - representation to specific states for the different curriculum subjects . The model of cognitive steering proposes that , in order to process epistemically varied environmental data , a heuristic orientation system is required to align varied , incoming environmental data with existing neural algorithmic processes . The brain 's associative simulation capacity , centered around the imagination , plays an integrator role to perform this function . Evidence for early - stage concept formation and future self - operation within the hippocampus supports the model , . In the cognitive steering model , a conscious state emerges from effortful associative simulation , required to align novel data accurately with remote memory , via later algorithmic processes . By contrast , fast unconscious automaticity is constituted by unregulated simulatory biases , which induce errors in subsequent algorithmic processes . The phrase ' rubbish in , rubbish out ' is used to explain errorful heuristic processing : errors will always occur if the accuracy of initial retrieval and location of data is poorly self - regulated . <\\/P> <H3> Application in economic behavior ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> According to Alos - Ferrer and Strack the dual - process theory has relevance in economic decision - making through the multiple - selves model , in which one person 's self - concept is composed of multiple selves depending on the context . An example of this is someone who as a student is hard working and intelligent , but as a sibling is caring and supportive . Decision - making involves the use of both automatic and controlled processes , but also depends on the person and situation , and given a person 's experiences and current situation the decision process may differ . Given that there are two decision processes with differing goals one is more likely to be more useful in particular situations . For example , a person is presented with a decision involving a selfish but rational motive and a social motive . Depending on the individual one of the motives will be more appealing than the other , but depending on the situation the preference for one motive or the other may change . Using the dual - process theory it is important to consider whether one motive is more automatic than the other , and in this particular case the automaticity would depend on the individual and their experiences . A selfish person may choose the selfish motive with more automaticity than a non-selfish person , and yet a controlled process may still outweigh this based on external factors such as the situation , monetary gains , or societal pressure . Although there is likely to be a stable preference for which motive one will select based on the individual it is important to remember that external factors will influence the decision . Dual process theory also provides a different source of behavioral heterogeneity in economics . It is mostly assumed within economics that this heterogeneity comes from differences in taste and rationality , while dual process theory indicates necessary considerations of which processes are automated and how these different processes may interact within decision making . <\\/P> <H2> Evidence ( edit ) <\\/H2> <H3> Belief bias effect ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> A belief bias is the tendency to judge the strength of arguments based on the plausibility of their conclusion rather than how strongly they support that conclusion . Some evidence suggests that this bias results from competition between logical ( System 2 ) and belief - based ( System 1 ) processes during evaluation of arguments . <\\/P> <P> Studies on belief - bias effect were first designed by Jonathan Evans to create a conflict between logical reasoning and prior knowledge about the truth of conclusions . Participants are asked to evaluate syllogisms that are : valid arguments with believable conclusions , valid arguments with unbelievable conclusions , invalid arguments with believable conclusions , and invalid arguments with unbelievable conclusions . Participants are told to only agree with conclusions that logically follow from the premises given . The results suggest when the conclusion is believable , people erroneously accept invalid conclusions as valid more often than invalid arguments are accepted which support unpalatable conclusions . This is taken to suggest that System 1 beliefs are interfering with the logic of System 2 . <\\/P> <H3> Tests with working memory ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> De Neys conducted a study that manipulated working memory capacity while answering syllogistic problems . This was done by burdening executive processes with secondary tasks . Results showed that when System 1 triggered the correct response , the distractor task had no effect on the production of a correct answer which supports the fact that System 1 is automatic and works independently of working memory , but when belief - bias was present ( System 1 belief - based response was different from the logically correct System 2 response ) the participants performance was impeded by the decreased availability of working memory . This falls in accordance with the knowledge about System 1 and System 2 of the dual - process accounts of reasoning because System 1 was shown to work independent of working memory , and System 2 was impeded due to a lack of working memory space so System 1 took over which resulted in a belief - bias . <\\/P> <H3> FMRI studies ( edit ) <\\/H3> Researcher conducting Functional magnetic resonance imaging test . <P> Vinod Goel and others produced neuropsychological evidence for dual - process accounts of reasoning using fMRI studies . They provided evidence that anatomically distinct parts of the brain were responsible for the two different kinds of reasoning . They found that content - based reasoning caused left temporal hemisphere activation whereas abstract formal problem reasoning activated the parietal system . They concluded that different kinds of reasoning , depending on the semantic content , activated one of two different systems in the brain . <\\/P> <P> A similar study incorporated fMRI during a belief - bias test . They found that different mental processes were competing for control of the response to the problems given in the belief - bias test . The prefrontal cortex was critical in detecting and resolving conflicts , which are characteristic of System 2 , and had already been associated with that System 2 . The ventral medial prefrontal cortex , known to be associated with the more intuitive or heuristic responses of System 1 , was the area in competition with the prefrontal cortex . <\\/P> <H3> Near - infrared spectroscopy ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> Tsujii and Watanabe did a follow - up study to Goel and Dolan 's fMRI experiment . They examined the neural correlates on the inferior frontal cortex ( IFC ) activity in belief - bias reasoning using near - infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) . Subjects performed a syllogistic reasoning task , using congruent and incongruent syllogisms , while attending to an attention - demanding secondary task . The interest of the researchers was in how the secondary - tasks changed the activity of the IFC during congruent and incongruent reasoning processes . The results showed that the participants performed better in the congruent test than in the incongruent test ( evidence for belief bias ) ; the high demand secondary test impaired the incongruent reasoning more than it impaired the congruent reasoning . NIRS results showed that the right IFC was activated more during incongruent trials . Participants with enhanced right IFC activity performed better on the incongruent reasoning than those with decreased right IFC activity . This study provided some evidence to enhance the fMRI results that the right IFC , specifically , is critical in resolving conflicting reasoning , but that it is also attention - demanding ; its effectiveness decreases with loss of attention . The loss of effectiveness in System 2 following loss of attention makes the automatic heuristic System 1 take over , which results in belief bias . <\\/P> <H3> Matching bias ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> Matching bias is a non-logical heuristic . The matching bias is described as a tendency to use lexical content matching of the statement about which one is reasoning , to be seen as relevant information and do the opposite as well , ignore relevant information that does n't match . It mostly affects problems with abstract content . It does n't involve prior knowledge and beliefs but it is still seen as a System 1 heuristic that competes with the logical System 2 . <\\/P> Example of the Wason selection task . <P> The Wason selection task provides evidence for the matching bias . The test is designed as a measure of a person 's logical thinking ability . Performance on the Wason Selection Task is sensitive to the content and context with which it is presented . If you introduce a negative component into the conditional statement of the Wason Selection Task , e.g. ' If there is an A one side of the card then there is not a 3 on the other side ' , there is a strong tendency to choose cards that match the items in the negative condition to test , regardless of their logical status . Changing the test to be a test of following rules rather than truth and falsity is another condition where the participants will ignore the logic because they will simply follow the rule , e.g. changing the test to be a test of a police officer looking for underaged drinkers . The original task is more difficult because it requires explicit and abstract logical thought from System 2 , and the police officer test is cued by relevant prior knowledge from System 1 . <\\/P> <P> Studies have shown that you can train people to inhibit matching bias which provides neuropsychological evidence for the dual - process theory of reasoning . When you compare trials before and after the training there is evidence for a forward shift in activated brain area . Pre-test results showed activation in locations along the ventral pathway and post-test results showed activation around the ventro - medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate . Matching bias has also been shown to generalise to syllogistic reasoning . <\\/P> <H3> Evolution ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> Dual - process theorists claim that System 2 , a general purpose reasoning system , evolved late and worked alongside the older autonomous sub-systems of System 1 . The success of Homo sapiens lends evidence to their higher cognitive abilities above other hominids . Mithen theorizes that the increase in cognitive ability occurred 50,000 years ago when representational art , imagery , and the design of tools and artefacts are first documented . She hypothesizes that this change was due to the adaptation of System 2 . <\\/P> <P> Most evolutionary psychologists do not agree with dual - process theorists . They claim that the mind is modular , and domain - specific , thus they disagree with the theory of the general reasoning ability of System 2 . They have difficulty agreeing that there are two distinct ways of reasoning and that one is evolutionarily old , and the other is new . To ease this discomfort , the theory is that once System 2 evolved , it became a ' long leash ' system without much genetic control which allowed humans to pursue their individual goals . <\\/P> <H3> Issues with the dual - process account of reasoning ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> The dual - process account of reasoning is an old theory , as noted above . But according to Evans it has adapted itself from the old , logicist paradigm , to the new theories that apply to other kinds of reasoning as well . And the theory seems more influential now than in the past which is questionable . Evans outlined 5 `` fallacies '' : <\\/P> <Ol> <Li> All dual - process theories are essentially the same . There is a tendency to assume all theories that propose two modes or styles of thinking are related and so they end up all lumped under the umbrella term of `` dual - process theories '' . <\\/Li> <Li> There are just two systems underlying System 1 and System 2 processing . There are clearly more than just two cognitive systems underlying people 's performance on dual - processing tasks . Hence the change to theorizing that processing is done in two minds that have different evolutionary histories and that each have multiple sub-systems . <\\/Li> <Li> System 1 processes are responsible for cognitive biases ; System 2 processes are responsible for normatively correct responding . Both System 1 and System 2 processing can lead to normative answers and both can involve cognitive biases . <\\/Li> <Li> System 1 processing is contextualised while System 2 processing is abstract . Recent research has found that beliefs and context can influence System 2 processing as well as System 1 . <\\/Li> <Li> Fast processing indicates the use of System 1 rather than System 2 processes . Just because a processing is fast does not mean it is done by System 1 . Experience and different heuristics can influence System 2 processing to go faster . <\\/Li> <\\/Ol> <P> Another argument against dual - process accounts for reasoning which was outlined by Osman is that the proposed dichotomy of System 1 and System 2 does not adequately accommodate the range of processes accomplished . Moshman proposed that there should be four possible types of processing as opposed to two . They would be implicit heuristic processing , implicit rule - based processing , explicit heuristic processing , and explicit rule - based processing . Another fine - grained division is as follows : implicit action - centered processes , implicit non-action - centered processes , explicit action - centered processes , and explicit non-action - centered processes ( that is , a four - way division reflecting both the implicit - explicit distinction and the procedural - declarative distinction ) . <\\/P> <P> In response to the question as to whether there are dichotomous processing types , many have instead proposed a single - system framework which incorporates a continuum between implicit and explicit processes . <\\/P> <H2> Alternative model ( edit ) <\\/H2> <P> The dynamic graded continuum ( DGC ) , originally proposed by Cleeremans and Jim\\u00e9nez is an alternative single system framework to the dual - process account of reasoning . It has not been accepted as better than the dual - process theory ; it is instead usually used as a comparison with which one can evaluate the dual - process model . The DGC proposes that differences in representation generate variation in forms of reasoning without assuming a multiple system framework . It describes how graded properties of the representations that are generated while reasoning result in the different types of reasoning . It separates terms like implicit and automatic processing where the dual - process model uses the terms interchangeably to refer to the whole of System 1 . Instead the DGC uses a continuum of reasoning that moves from implicit , to explicit , to automatic . <\\/P> <H2> Fuzzy - trace theory ( edit ) <\\/H2> <P> According to Charles Brainerd and Valerie Reyna 's fuzzy - trace theory of memory and reasoning , people have two memory representations : verbatim and gist . Verbatim is memory for surface information ( e.g. the words in this sentence ) whereas gist is memory for semantic information ( e.g. the meaning of this sentence ) . <\\/P> <P> This dual process theory posits that we encode , store , retrieve , and forget the information in these two traces of memory separately and completely independently of each other . Furthermore , the two memory traces decay at different rates : verbatim decays quickly , while gist lasts longer . <\\/P> <P> In terms of reasoning , fuzzy - trace theory posits that as we mature , we increasingly rely more on gist information over verbatim information . Evidence for this lies in framing experiments where framing effects become stronger when verbatim information ( percentages ) are replaced with gist descriptions . Other experiments rule out predictions of prospect theory ( extended and original ) as well as other current theories of judgment and decision making . <\\/P> <H2> See also ( edit ) <\\/H2> <Ul> <Li> Automatic and controlled processes ( ACP ) <\\/Li> <Li> Cognitive inhibition <\\/Li> <Li> Dual process model of coping <\\/Li> <Li> Dual process theory ( moral psychology ) <\\/Li> <Li> Opponent - process theory <\\/Li> <\\/Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) <\\/H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Vaisey , Stephen ( 2009 - 05 - 01 ) . `` Motivation and Justification : A Dual \\u2010 Process Model of Culture in Action '' .

They were established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel , which dictates that the awards should be administered by the Nobel Foundation . The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was established in 1968 by the Sveriges Riksbank , the central bank of Sweden , for contributions to the field of economics . Each recipient , or `` laureate '' , receives a gold medal , a diploma , and a sum of money , which is decided annually by the Nobel Foundation . <\\/P> <H2> Contents <\\/H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Prize <\\/Li> <Li> 2 Laureates <\\/Li> <Li> 3 List of laureates <\\/Li> <Li> 4 Notes <\\/Li> <Li> 5 See also <\\/Li> <Li> 6 References <\\/Li> <Li> 7 External links <\\/Li> <\\/Ul> <H2> Prize <\\/H2> <P> Each prize is awarded by a separate committee ; the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards the Prizes in Physics , Chemistry , and Economics , the Karolinska Institute awards the Prize in Physiology or Medicine , and the Norwegian Nobel Committee awards the Prize in Peace . Each recipient receives a medal , a diploma and a monetary award that has varied throughout the years . In 1901 , the recipients of the first Nobel Prizes were given 150,782 SEK , which is equal to 8,402,670 SEK in December 2017 . In 2017 , the laureates were awarded a prize amount of 9,000,000 SEK . The awards are presented in Stockholm in an annual ceremony on December 10 , the anniversary of Nobel 's death . <\\/P> <P> In years in which the Nobel Prize is not awarded due to external events or a lack of nominations , the prize money is returned to the funds delegated to the relevant prize . The Nobel Prize was not awarded between 1940 and 1942 due to the outbreak of World War II . <\\/P> <H2> Laureates <\\/H2> <P> Between 1901 and 2017 , the Nobel Prizes and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences were awarded 585 times to 923 people and organizations . With some receiving the Nobel Prize more than once , this makes a total of 892 individuals ( including 844 men , 48 women ) and 24 organizations . Four Nobel laureates were not permitted by their governments to accept the Nobel Prize . Adolf Hitler forbade three Germans , Richard Kuhn ( Chemistry , 1938 ) , Adolf Butenandt ( Chemistry , 1939 ) , and Gerhard Domagk ( Physiology or Medicine , 1939 ) , from accepting their Nobel Prizes , and the government of the Soviet Union pressured Boris Pasternak ( Literature , 1958 ) to decline his award . Two Nobel laureates , Jean - Paul Sartre ( Literature , 1964 ) and L\\u00ea \\u00d0\\u1ee9c Th\\u1ecd ( Peace , 1973 ) , declined the award ; Sartre declined the award as he declined all official honors , and L\\u00ea declined the award due to the situation Vietnam was in at the time . <\\/P> <P> Six laureates have received more than one prize ; of the six , the International Committee of the Red Cross has received the Nobel Peace Prize three times , more than any other . UNHCR has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize twice . Also the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to John Bardeen twice , and the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Frederick Sanger . Two laureates have been awarded twice but not in the same field : Marie Curie ( Physics and Chemistry ) and Linus Pauling ( Chemistry and Peace ) . Among the 892 Nobel laureates , 48 have been women ; the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize was Marie Curie , who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 . She was also the first person ( male or female ) to be awarded two Nobel Prizes , the second award being the Nobel Prize in Chemistry , given in 1911 . <\\/P> <H2> List of laureates <\\/H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Year <\\/Th> <Th> Physics <\\/Th> <Th> Chemistry <\\/Th> <Th> Physiology or Medicine <\\/Th> <Th> Literature <\\/Th> <Th> Peace <\\/Th> <Th> Economics <\\/Th> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1901 <\\/Td> <Td> Wilhelm R\\u00f6ntgen <\\/Td> <Td> Jacobus Henricus van ' t Hoff <\\/Td> <Td> Emil Adolf von Behring <\\/Td> <Td> Sully Prudhomme <\\/Td> <Td> Henry Dunant ; Fr\\u00e9d\\u00e9ric Passy <\\/Td> <Td> -- <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1902 <\\/Td> <Td> Hendrik Lorentz ; Pieter Zeeman <\\/Td> <Td> Hermann Emil Fischer <\\/Td> <Td> Ronald Ross <\\/Td> <Td> Theodor Mommsen <\\/Td> <Td> \\u00c9lie Ducommun ; Charles Albert Gobat <\\/Td> <Td> -- <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1903 <\\/Td> <Td> Henri Becquerel ; Pierre Curie ; Marie Curie <\\/Td> <Td> Svante Arrhenius <\\/Td> <Td> Niels Ryberg Finsen <\\/Td> <Td> Bj\\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\\u00f8rnson <\\/Td> <Td> Randal Cremer <\\/Td> <Td> -- <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1904 <\\/Td> <Td> Lord Rayleigh <\\/Td> <Td> William Ramsay <\\/Td> <Td> Ivan Pavlov <\\/Td> <Td> Fr\\u00e9d\\u00e9ric Mistral ; Jos\\u00e9 Echegaray <\\/Td> <Td> Institut de Droit International <\\/Td> <Td> -- <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1905 <\\/Td> <Td> Philipp Lenard <\\/Td> <Td> Adolf von Baeyer <\\/Td> <Td> Robert Koch <\\/Td> <Td> Henryk Sienkiewicz <\\/Td> <Td> Bertha von Suttner <\\/Td> <Td> -- <\\/Td> <\\/Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1906 <\\/Td> <Td> J.J.

The three were Richard Kuhn , Nobel laureate in Chemistry in 1938 ; Adolf Butenandt , Nobel laureate in Chemistry in 1939 ; and Gerhard Domagk , Nobel laureate in Physiology or Medicine in 1939 . They were later awarded the Nobel Prize diploma and medal , but not the money . <\\/Li> <Li> In 1948 , the Nobel Prize in Peace was not awarded . The Nobel Foundation 's website suggests that it would have been awarded to Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi , however , due to his assassination earlier that year , it was left unassigned in his honor . <\\/Li> <Li> In 1958 , Russian - born Boris Pasternak , under pressure from the government of the Soviet Union , was forced to decline the Nobel Prize in Literature . <\\/Li> <Li> In 1964 , Jean - Paul Sartre refused to accept the Nobel Prize in Literature , as he had consistently refused all official honors in the past . <\\/Li> <Li> In 1973 , L\\u00ea \\u00d0\\u1ee9c Th\\u1ecd declined the Nobel Peace Prize . His reason was that he felt he did not deserve it because although he helped negotiate the Paris Peace Accords ( a cease - fire in the Vietnam War ) , there had been no actual peace agreement . <\\/Li> <Li> In 2010 , Liu Xiaobo was unable to receive the Nobel Peace Prize as he was sentenced to 11 years of imprisonment by the Chinese authorities . <\\/Li> <\\/Ul> <H2> See also <\\/H2> <Ul> <Li> List of Nobel laureates by country <\\/Li> <Li> List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation <\\/Li> <Li> Nobel Prize laureates by secondary school affiliation <\\/Li> <\\/Ul> <H2> References <\\/H2> <Dl> <Dt> General <\\/Dt> <\\/Dl> <Ul> <Li> `` All Nobel Laureates in Physics '' .

Later , there have been speculations that the committee members could have had another deceased peace worker than Gandhi in mind when they declared that there was `` no suitable living candidate '' , namely the Swedish UN envoy to Palestine , Count Bernadotte , who was murdered in September 1948 . Today , this can be ruled out ; Bernadotte had not been nominated in 1948 .

It is one of the 20th century 's most famous and distinctive buildings . <\\/P> <P> Designed by Danish architect J\\u00f8rn Utzon , the building was formally opened on 20 October 1973 after a gestation beginning with Utzon 's 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition . The Government of New South Wales , led by the premier , Joseph Cahill , authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon directing construction . The government 's decision to build Utzon 's design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed , including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect 's ultimate resignation . <\\/P> <P> The building and its surrounds occupy the whole of Bennelong Point on Sydney Harbour , between Sydney Cove and Farm Cove , adjacent to the Sydney central business district and the Royal Botanic Gardens , and close by the Sydney Harbour Bridge . <\\/P> <P> Though its name suggests a single venue , the building comprises multiple performance venues which together host well over 1,500 performances annually , attended by more than 1.2 million people . Performances are presented by numerous performing artists , including three resident companies : Opera Australia , the Sydney Theatre Company and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra . As one of the most popular visitor attractions in Australia , more than eight million people visit the site annually , and approximately 350,000 visitors take a guided tour of the building each year . The building is managed by the Sydney Opera House Trust , an agency of the New South Wales State Government . <\\/P> <P> On 28 June 2007 , the Sydney Opera House became a UNESCO World Heritage Site ; having been listed on the ( now defunct ) Register of the National Estate since 1980 , the National Trust of Australia register since 1983 , the City of Sydney Heritage Inventory since 2000 , the New South Wales State Heritage Register since 2003 , and the Australian National Heritage List since 2005 . <\\/P> <H2> Contents <\\/H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Description <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Performance venues and facilities <\\/Li> <Li> 1.2 Other facilities <\\/Li> <\\/Ul> <\\/Li> <Li> 2 Construction history <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Origins <\\/Li> <Li> 2.2 Design and construction <Ul> <Li> 2.2. 1 Stage I : Podium <\\/Li> <Li> 2.2. 2 Stage II : Roof <\\/Li> <Li> 2.2. 3 Stage III : Interiors <\\/Li> <\\/Ul> <\\/Li> <Li> 2.3 Significant changes to Utzon 's design <\\/Li> <Li> 2.4 Completion and cost <\\/Li> <\\/Ul> <\\/Li> <Li> 3 Utzon and his resignation <\\/Li> <Li> 4 Architectural design role of Peter Hall <\\/Li> <Li> 5 Opening <\\/Li> <Li> 6 Performance firsts <\\/Li> <Li> 7 Reconciliation with Utzon ; building refurbishment <\\/Li> <Li> 8 Public and commemorative events <\\/Li> <Li> 9 Advertising controversy <\\/Li> <Li> 10 Notable performances <\\/Li> <Li> 11 Awards <\\/Li> <Li> 12 See also <\\/Li> <Li> 13 References <Ul> <Li> 13.1 Attribution <\\/Li> <\\/Ul> <\\/Li> <Li> 14 Bibliography <\\/Li> <Li> 15 External links <\\/Li> <\\/Ul> <H2> Description ( edit ) <\\/H2> <P> The facility features a modern expressionist design , with a series of large precast concrete `` shells '' , each composed of sections of a sphere of 75.2 metres ( 246 ft 8.6 in ) radius , forming the roofs of the structure , set on a monumental podium . The building covers 1.8 hectares ( 4.4 acres ) of land and is 183 m ( 600 ft ) long and 120 m ( 394 ft ) wide at its widest point . It is supported on 588 concrete piers sunk as much as 25 m ( 82 ft ) below sea level . <\\/P> <P> Although the roof structures are commonly referred to as `` shells '' ( as in this article ) , they are precast concrete panels supported by precast concrete ribs , not shells in a strictly structural sense . Though the shells appear uniformly white from a distance , they actually feature a subtle chevron pattern composed of 1,056,006 tiles in two colours : glossy white and matte cream . The tiles were manufactured by the Swedish company H\\u00f6gan\\u00e4s AB which generally produced stoneware tiles for the paper - mill industry . <\\/P> <P> Apart from the tile of the shells and the glass curtain walls of the foyer spaces , the building 's exterior is largely clad with aggregate panels composed of pink granite quarried at Tarana . Significant interior surface treatments also include off - form concrete , Australian white birch plywood supplied from Wauchope in northern New South Wales , and brush box glulam . <\\/P> <P> Of the two larger spaces , the Concert Hall is in the western group of shells , the Joan Sutherland Theatre in the eastern group . The scale of the shells was chosen to reflect the internal height requirements , with low entrance spaces , rising over the seating areas up to the high stage towers . The smaller venues ( the Drama Theatre , the Playhouse and the Studio ) are within the podium , beneath the Concert Hall . A smaller group of shells set to the western side of the Monumental Steps houses the Bennelong Restaurant . The podium is surrounded by substantial open public spaces , and the large stone - paved forecourt area with the adjacent monumental steps is regularly used as a performance space . <\\/P> <H3> Performance venues and facilities ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> The Sydney Opera House includes a number of performance venues : <\\/P> <Ul> <Li> Concert Hall : With 2,679 seats , the home of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and used by a large number of other concert presenters . It contains the Sydney Opera House Grand Organ , the largest mechanical tracker action organ in the world , with over 10,000 pipes . <\\/Li> <Li> Joan Sutherland Theatre : A proscenium theatre with 1,507 seats , the Sydney home of Opera Australia and The Australian Ballet . Until 17 October 2012 it was known as the Opera Theatre . <\\/Li> <Li> Drama Theatre : A proscenium theatre with 544 seats , used by the Sydney Theatre Company and other dance and theatrical presenters . <\\/Li> <Li> Playhouse : A non-proscenium end - stage theatre with 398 seats . <\\/Li> <Li> Studio : A flexible space with 280 permanent seats ( some of which can be folded up ) and a maximum capacity of 400 , depending on configuration . <\\/Li> <Li> Utzon Room : A small multi-purpose venue for parties , corporate functions and small productions ( such as chamber music performances ) . <\\/Li> <Li> Recording Studio <\\/Li> <Li> Outdoor Forecourt : A flexible open - air venue with a wide range of configuration options , including the possibility of utilising the Monumental Steps as audience seating , used for a range of community events and major outdoor performances . <\\/Li> <\\/Ul> <P> Other areas ( for example the northern and western foyers ) are also used for performances on an occasional basis . Venues are also used for conferences , ceremonies and social functions . <\\/P> <H3> Other facilities ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> The building also houses a recording studio , cafes , restaurants , bars and retail outlets . Guided tours are available , including a frequent tour of the front - of - house spaces , and a daily backstage tour that takes visitors backstage to see areas normally reserved for performers and crew members . <\\/P> Interior of the Concert Hall <H2> Construction history ( edit ) <\\/H2> <H3> Origins ( edit ) <\\/H3> Bennelong Point with tram depot in the 1920s ( top left - hand side of photograph ) Construction progress in 1966 <P> Planning began in the late 1940s , when Eugene Goossens , the Director of the NSW State Conservatorium of Music , lobbied for a suitable venue for large theatrical productions . The normal venue for such productions , the Sydney Town Hall , was not considered large enough . By 1954 , Goossens succeeded in gaining the support of NSW Premier Joseph Cahill , who called for designs for a dedicated opera house . It was also Goossens who insisted that Bennelong Point be the site : Cahill had wanted it to be on or near Wynyard Railway Station in the northwest of the CBD . <\\/P> <P> An international design competition was launched by Cahill on 13 September 1955 and received 233 entries , representing architects from 32 countries . The criteria specified a large hall seating 3,000 and a small hall for 1,200 people , each to be designed for different uses , including full - scale operas , orchestral and choral concerts , mass meetings , lectures , ballet performances , and other presentations . <\\/P> <P> The winner , announced in 1957 , was J\\u00f8rn Utzon , a Danish architect . According to legend the Utzon design was rescued by noted Finnish - American architect Eero Saarinen from a final cut of 30 `` rejects '' . The runner - up was an entry by firm GBQC of Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . The grand prize was 5,000 Australian pounds . Utzon visited Sydney in 1957 to help supervise the project . His office moved to Palm Beach , Sydney in February 1963 . <\\/P> <P> Utzon received the Pritzker Architecture Prize , architecture 's highest honour , in 2003 . The Pritzker Prize citation read : <\\/P> <P> There is no doubt that the Sydney Opera House is his masterpiece . It is one of the great iconic buildings of the 20th century , an image of great beauty that has become known throughout the world -- a symbol for not only a city , but a whole country and continent . <\\/P> <H3> Design and construction ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> The Fort Macquarie Tram Depot , occupying the site at the time of these plans , was demolished in 1958 and construction began in March 1959 . It was built in three stages : stage I ( 1959 -- 1963 ) consisted of building the upper podium ; stage II ( 1963 -- 1967 ) the construction of the outer shells ; stage III ( 1967 -- 1973 ) interior design and construction . <\\/P> Stage I : podium ( edit ) <P> Stage I commenced on 2 March 1959 with the construction firm Civil & Civic , monitored by the engineers Ove Arup and Partners . The government had pushed for work to begin early , fearing that funding , or public opinion , might turn against them . However , Utzon had still not completed the final designs . Major structural issues still remained unresolved . By 23 January 1961 , work was running 47 weeks behind , mainly because of unexpected difficulties ( inclement weather , unexpected difficulty diverting stormwater , construction beginning before proper construction drawings had been prepared , changes of original contract documents ) . Work on the podium was finally completed in February 1963 . The forced early start led to significant later problems , not least of which was the fact that the podium columns were not strong enough to support the roof structure , and had to be re-built . <\\/P> Stage II : roof ( edit ) Further information : Mathematics and art Construction progress in 1968 <P> The shells of the competition entry were originally of undefined geometry , but , early in the design process , the `` shells '' were perceived as a series of parabolas supported by precast concrete ribs . However , engineers Ove Arup and Partners were unable to find an acceptable solution to constructing them . The formwork for using in - situ concrete would have been prohibitively expensive , and , because there was no repetition in any of the roof forms , the construction of precast concrete for each individual section would possibly have been even more expensive . <\\/P> Sydney Opera House shell ribs The glazed ceramic tiles of the Sydney Opera House <P> From 1957 to 1963 , the design team went through at least 12 iterations of the form of the shells trying to find an economically acceptable form ( including schemes with parabolas , circular ribs and ellipsoids ) before a workable solution was completed . The design work on the shells involved one of the earliest uses of computers in structural analysis , to understand the complex forces to which the shells would be subjected . The computer system was also used in the assembly of the arches . The pins in the arches were surveyed at the end of each day , and the information was entered into the computer so the next arch could be properly placed the following day . In mid-1961 , the design team found a solution to the problem : the shells all being created as sections from a sphere . This solution allows arches of varying length to be cast in a common mould , and a number of arch segments of common length to be placed adjacent to one another , to form a spherical section . With whom exactly this solution originated has been the subject of some controversy . It was originally credited to Utzon . Ove Arup 's letter to Ashworth , a member of the Sydney Opera House Executive Committee , states : `` Utzon came up with an idea of making all the shells of uniform curvature throughout in both directions . '' Peter Jones , the author of Ove Arup 's biography , states that `` the architect and his supporters alike claimed to recall the precise eureka moment ... ; the engineers and some of their associates , with equal conviction , recall discussion in both central London and at Ove 's house . '' <\\/P> <P> He goes on to claim that `` the existing evidence shows that Arup 's canvassed several possibilities for the geometry of the shells , from parabolas to ellipsoids and spheres . '' Yuzo Mikami , a member of the design team , presents an opposite view in his book on the project , Utzon 's Sphere . It is unlikely that the truth will ever be categorically known , but there is a clear consensus that the design team worked very well indeed for the first part of the project and that Utzon , Arup , and Ronald Jenkins ( partner of Ove Arup and Partners responsible for the Opera House project ) all played a very significant part in the design development . <\\/P> <P> As Peter Murray states in The Saga of the Sydney Opera House : <\\/P> <P> ... the two men -- and their teams -- enjoyed a collaboration that was remarkable in its fruitfulness and , despite many traumas , was seen by most of those involved in the project as a high point of architect \\/ engineer collaboration . <\\/P> <P> The design of the roof was tested on scale models in wind tunnels at University of Southampton and later NPL in order to establish the wind - pressure distribution around the roof shape in very high winds , which helped in the design of the roof tiles and their fixtures . <\\/P> <P> The shells were constructed by Hornibrook Group Pty Ltd , who were also responsible for construction in Stage III . Hornibrook manufactured the 2400 precast ribs and 4000 roof panels in an on - site factory and also developed the construction processes . The achievement of this solution avoided the need for expensive formwork construction by allowing the use of precast units ( it also allowed the roof tiles to be prefabricated in sheets on the ground , instead of being stuck on individually at height ) . Ove Arup and Partners ' site engineer supervised the construction of the shells , which used an innovative adjustable steel - trussed `` erection arch '' to support the different roofs before completion . On 6 April 1962 , it was estimated that the Opera House would be completed between August 1964 and March 1965 . <\\/P> Stage III : interiors ( edit ) The Concert Hall and organ View from the stage of the Concert Hall . View from the stage of the Joan Sutherland Theatre . Interior of the Studio Theatre . <P> Stage III , the interiors , started with Utzon moving his entire office to Sydney in February 1963 . However , there was a change of government in 1965 , and the new Robert Askin government declared the project under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Public Works . Due to the Ministry 's criticism of the project 's costs and time , along with their impression of Utzon 's designs being impractical , this ultimately led to his resignation in 1966 ( see below ) . <\\/P> <P> The cost of the project so far , even in October 1966 , was still only $22.9 million , less than a quarter of the final $102 million cost . However , the projected costs for the design were at this stage much more significant . <\\/P> <P> The second stage of construction was progressing toward completion when Utzon resigned . His position was principally taken over by Peter Hall , who became largely responsible for the interior design . Other persons appointed that same year to replace Utzon were E.H. Farmer as government architect , D.S. Littlemore and Lionel Todd . <\\/P> <P> Following Utzon 's resignation , the acoustic advisor , Lothar Cremer , confirmed to the Sydney Opera House Executive Committee ( SOHEC ) that Utzon 's original acoustic design allowed for only 2000 seats in the main hall and further stated that increasing the number of seats to 3000 as specified in the brief would be disastrous for the acoustics . According to Peter Jones , the stage designer , Martin Carr , criticised the `` shape , height and width of the stage , the physical facilities for artists , the location of the dressing rooms , the widths of doors and lifts , and the location of lighting switchboards . '' <\\/P> <H3> Significant changes to Utzon 's design ( edit ) <\\/H3> The foyer of the Joan Sutherland Theatre , showing the internal structure and steel framing of the glass curtain walls ; the final constructions were modified from Utzon 's original designs The Opera House at sunset <Ul> <Li> The major hall , which was originally to be a multipurpose opera \\/ concert hall , became solely a concert hall , called the Concert Hall . The minor hall , originally for stage productions only , incorporated opera and ballet functions and was called the Opera Theatre , later renamed the Joan Sutherland Theatre . As a result , the Joan Sutherland Theatre is inadequate to stage large - scale opera and ballet . A theatre , a cinema and a library were also added . These were later changed to two live drama theatres and a smaller theatre `` in the round '' . These now comprise the Drama Theatre , the Playhouse and the Studio respectively . These changes were primarily because of inadequacies in the original competition brief , which did not make it adequately clear how the Opera House was to be used . The layout of the interiors was changed , and the stage machinery , already designed and fitted inside the major hall , was pulled out and largely thrown away , as detailed in the 1968 BBC TV documentary Autopsy on a Dream , which `` chronicles the full spectrum of controversy surrounding the construction of the Sydney Opera House '' . <\\/Li> <Li> Externally , the cladding to the podium and the paving ( the podium was originally not to be clad down to the water , but to be left open ) . <\\/Li> <Li> The construction of the glass walls ( Utzon was planning to use a system of prefabricated plywood mullions , but a different system was designed to deal with the glass ) . <\\/Li> <Li> Utzon 's plywood corridor designs , and his acoustic and seating designs for the interior of both major halls , were scrapped completely . His design for the Concert Hall was rejected as it only seated 2000 , which was considered insufficient . Utzon employed the acoustic consultant Lothar Cremer , and his designs for the major halls were later modelled and found to be very good . The subsequent Todd , Hall and Littlemore versions of both major halls have some problems with acoustics , particularly for the performing musicians . The orchestra pit in the Joan Sutherland Theatre is cramped and dangerous to musicians ' hearing . The Concert Hall has a very high roof , leading to a lack of early reflections onstage -- perspex rings ( the `` acoustic clouds '' ) hanging over the stage were added shortly before opening in an ( unsuccessful ) attempt to address this problem . <\\/Li> <\\/Ul> <H3> Completion and cost ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> The Opera House was formally completed in 1973 , having cost $ 102 million . H.R. `` Sam '' Hoare , the Hornibrook director in charge of the project , provided the following approximations in 1973 : Stage I : podium Civil & Civic Pty Ltd approximately $5.5 m . Stage II : roof shells M.R. Hornibrook ( NSW ) Pty Ltd approximately $12.5 m . Stage III : completion The Hornibrook Group $56.5 m . Separate contracts : stage equipment , stage lighting and organ $9.0 m . Fees and other costs : $16.5 m . <\\/P> <P> The original cost and scheduling estimates in 1957 projected a cost of \\u00a3 3,500,000 ( $7 million ) and completion date of 26 January 1963 ( Australia Day ) . In reality , the project was completed ten years late and 1,357 % over budget in real terms . <\\/P> <H2> Utzon and his resignation ( edit ) <\\/H2> The building illuminated at night <P> Before the Sydney Opera House competition , J\\u00f8rn Utzon had won seven of the 18 competitions he had entered but had never seen any of his designs built . Utzon 's submitted concept for the Sydney Opera House was almost universally admired and considered groundbreaking . The Assessors Report of January 1957 , stated : <\\/P> <P> The drawings submitted for this scheme are simple to the point of being diagrammatic . Nevertheless , as we have returned again and again to the study of these drawings , we are convinced that they present a concept of an Opera House which is capable of becoming one of the great buildings of the world . <\\/P> <P> For the first stage , Utzon worked successfully with the rest of the design team and the client , but , as the project progressed , the Cahill government insisted on progressive revisions . They also did not fully appreciate the costs or work involved in design and construction . Tensions between the client and the design team grew further when an early start to construction was demanded despite an incomplete design . This resulted in a continuing series of delays and setbacks while various technical engineering issues were being refined . The building was unique , and the problems with the design issues and cost increases were exacerbated by commencement of work before the completion of the final plans . <\\/P> <P> After the 1965 election of the Liberal Party , with Robert Askin becoming Premier of New South Wales , the relationship of client , architect , engineers and contractors became increasingly tense . Askin had been a `` vocal critic of the project prior to gaining office . '' His new Minister for Public Works , Davis Hughes , was even less sympathetic . Elizabeth Farrelly , an Australian architecture critic , wrote that : <\\/P> <P> at an election night dinner party in Mosman , Hughes ' daughter Sue Burgoyne boasted that her father would soon sack Utzon . Hughes had no interest in art , architecture or aesthetics . A fraud , as well as a philistine , he had been exposed before Parliament and dumped as Country Party leader for 19 years of falsely claiming a university degree . The Opera House gave Hughes a second chance . For him , as for Utzon , it was all about control ; about the triumph of homegrown mediocrity over foreign genius . <\\/P> The Opera House seen from the north <P> Differences ensued . One of the first was that Utzon believed the clients should receive information on all aspects of the design and construction through his practice , while the clients wanted a system ( notably drawn in sketch form by Davis Hughes ) where architect , contractors , and engineers each reported to the client directly and separately . This had great implications for procurement methods and cost control , with Utzon wishing to negotiate contracts with chosen suppliers ( such as Ralph Symonds for the plywood interiors ) and the New South Wales government insisting contracts be put out to tender . <\\/P> <P> Utzon was highly reluctant to respond to questions or criticism from the client 's Sydney Opera House Executive Committee ( SOHEC ) . However , he was greatly supported throughout by a member of the committee and one of the original competition judges , Harry Ingham Ashworth . Utzon was unwilling to compromise on some aspects of his designs that the clients wanted to change . <\\/P> <P> Utzon 's ability was never in doubt , despite questions raised by Davis Hughes , who attempted to portray Utzon as an impractical dreamer . Ove Arup actually stated that Utzon was `` probably the best of any I have come across in my long experience of working with architects '' and : `` The Opera House could become the world 's foremost contemporary masterpiece if Utzon is given his head . '' <\\/P> The Opera House , backed by the Sydney Harbour Bridge , from the eastern Botanic Gardens <P> In October 1965 , Utzon gave Hughes a schedule setting out the completion dates of parts of his work for stage III . Utzon was at this time working closely with Ralph Symonds , a manufacturer of plywood based in Sydney and highly regarded by many , despite an Arup engineer warning that Ralph Symonds 's `` knowledge of the design stresses of plywood , was extremely sketchy '' and that the technical advice was `` elementary to say the least and completely useless for our purposes . '' Australian architecture critic Elizabeth Farrelly has referred to Ove Arup 's project engineer Michael Lewis as having `` other agendas '' . In any case , Hughes shortly after withheld permission for the construction of plywood prototypes for the interiors , and the relationship between Utzon and the client never recovered . By February 1966 , Utzon was owed more than $100,000 in fees . Hughes then withheld funding so that Utzon could not even pay his own staff . The government minutes record that following several threats of resignation , Utzon finally stated to Davis Hughes : `` If you do n't do it , I resign . '' Hughes replied : `` I accept your resignation . Thank you very much . Goodbye . '' <\\/P> The Opera House seen from The Rocks The Sydney Opera House during Vivid Sydney ( 2013 ) . <P> Utzon left the project on 28 February 1966 . He said that Hughes 's refusal to pay him any fees and the lack of collaboration caused his resignation and later famously described the situation as `` Malice in Blunderland '' . In March 1966 , Hughes offered him a subordinate role as `` design architect '' under a panel of executive architects , without any supervisory powers over the House 's construction , but Utzon rejected this . Utzon left the country never to return . <\\/P> <P> Following the resignation , there was great controversy about who was in the right and who was in the wrong . The Sydney Morning Herald initially opined : `` No architect in the world has enjoyed greater freedom than Mr Utzon . Few clients have been more patient or more generous than the people and the Government of NSW . One would not like history to record that this partnership was brought to an end by a fit of temper on the one side or by a fit of meanness on the other . '' On 17 March 1966 , the Herald offered the view that : `` It was not his ( Utzon 's ) fault that a succession of Governments and the Opera House Trust should so signally have failed to impose any control or order on the project ... his concept was so daring that he himself could solve its problems only step by step ... his insistence on perfection led him to alter his design as he went along . '' <\\/P> <P> The Sydney Opera House opened the way for the immensely complex geometries of some modern architecture . The design was one of the first examples of the use of computer - aided design to design complex shapes . The design techniques developed by Utzon and Arup for the Sydney Opera House have been further developed and are now used for architecture , such as works of Gehry and blobitecture , as well as most reinforced concrete structures . The design is also one of the first in the world to use araldite to glue the precast structural elements together and proved the concept for future use . <\\/P> <P> It was also a first in mechanical engineering . Another Danish firm , Steensen Varming , was responsible for designing the new air - conditioning plant , the largest in Australia at the time , supplying over 600,000 cubic feet ( 17,000 m ) of air per minute , using the innovative idea of harnessing the harbour water to create a water - cooled heat pump system that is still in operation today . <\\/P> <H2> Architectural design role of Peter Hall ( edit ) <\\/H2> <P> After the resignation of Utzon , the Minister for Public Works , Davis Hughes , and the Government Architect , Ted Farmer , organised a team to bring the Sydney Opera House to completion . The architectural work was divided between three appointees who became the Hall , Todd , Littlemore partnership . David Littlemore would manage construction supervision , Lionel Todd contract documentation , while the crucial role of design became the responsibility of Peter Hall . <\\/P> <P> Peter Hall ( 1931 -- 1995 ) completed a combined arts and architecture degree at Sydney University . Upon graduation a travel scholarship enabled him to spend twelve months in Europe during which time he visited Utzon in Helleb\\u00e6k . Returning to Sydney , Hall worked for the Government Architect , a branch of the NSW Public Works Department . While there he established himself as a talented design architect with a number of court and university buildings , including the Goldstein Hall at the University of New South Wales , which won the Sir John Sulman Medal in 1964 . <\\/P> <P> Hall resigned from the Government Architects office in early 1966 to pursue his own practice . When approached to take on the design role , ( after at least two prominent Sydney architects had declined ) , Hall spoke with Utzon by phone before accepting the position . Utzon reportedly told Hall : he ( Hall ) would not be able to finish the job and the Government would have to invite him back . Hall also sought the advice of others , including architect Don Gazzard who warned him acceptance would be a bad career move as the project would `` never be his own '' . <\\/P> <P> Hall agreed to accept the role on the condition there was no possibility of Utzon returning . Even so , his appointment did not go down well with many of his fellow architects who considered that no one but Utzon should complete the Sydney Opera House . Upon Utzon 's dismissal , a rally of protest had marched to Bennelong Point . A petition was also circulated , including in the Government Architects office . Peter Hall was one of the many who had signed the petition that called for Utzon 's reinstatement . <\\/P> <P> When Hall agreed to the design role and was appointed in April 1966 , he imagined he would find the design and documentation for the Stage III well advanced . What he found was an enormous amount of work ahead of him with many aspects completely unresolved by Utzon in relation to seating capacity , acoustics and structure . In addition Hall found the project had proceeded for nine years without the development of a concise client brief . To bring himself up to speed , Hall investigated concert and opera venues overseas and engaged stage consultant Ben Schlange and acoustic consultant Wilhelm Jordan , while establishing his team . In consultation with all the potential building users the first Review of Program was completed in January 1967 . The most significant conclusion reached by Hall was that concert and opera were incompatible in the same hall . Although Utzon had sketched ideas using plywood for the great enclosing glass walls , their structural viability was unresolved when Hall took on the design role . With the ability to delegate tasks and effectively coordinate the work of consultants , Hall guided the project for over five years until the opening day in 1973 . <\\/P> <P> A former Government Architect , Peter Webber , in his book Peter Hall : the Phantom of the Opera House , concludes : when Utzon resigned no one was better qualified ( than Hall ) to rise to the challenge of completing the design of the Opera House . <\\/P> <H2> Opening ( edit ) <\\/H2> Tourists observing the Opera House . <P> The Sydney Opera House was formally opened by Elizabeth II , Queen of Australia , on 20 October 1973 . A large crowd attended . Utzon was not invited to the ceremony , nor was his name mentioned . The opening was televised and included fireworks and a performance of Beethoven 's Symphony No. 9 . <\\/P> <H2> Performance firsts ( edit ) <\\/H2> <P> During the construction phase , lunchtime performances were often arranged for the workers , with American vocalist Paul Robeson the first artist to perform , in 1960 . <\\/P> <P> Various performances were presented prior to the official opening : <\\/P> <Ul> <Li> The first solo piano recital was in the Concert Hall on 10 April 1973 , played by Romola Costantino to an invited audience . <\\/Li> <Li> The first opera performed was Sergei Prokofiev 's War and Peace , in what was then known as the Opera Theatre on 28 September 1973 , conducted by the Australian Opera 's Music Director , Edward Downes . ( It had been intended that Peter Sculthorpe 's work Rites of Passage would have this honour , but it was not ready on time . Rites of Passage was premiered almost exactly a year later , on 27 September 1974 . ) <\\/Li> <Li> The first evening performance of an opera was Larry Sitsky 's The Fall of the House of Usher , conducted by Rex Hobcroft and paired with Dalgerie by James Penberthy , to a libretto by Mary Durack ; it took place on 25 July 1973 . <\\/Li> <Li> The first public concert in the Concert Hall took place on 29 September 1973 . It was an all - Wagner orchestral concert performed by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra , conducted by Charles Mackerras and with Birgit Nilsson as the soprano soloist . The first music played was the Prelude to Die Meistersinger von N\\u00fcrnberg . The concert closed with the Immolation Scene from G\\u00f6tterd\\u00e4mmerung . <\\/Li> <\\/Ul> <P> After the opening : <\\/P> <Ul> <Li> The first violin and piano recital was given by Wanda Wi\\u0142komirska , with pianist Geoffrey Parsons . <\\/Li> <\\/Ul> <H2> Reconciliation with Utzon ; building refurbishment ( edit ) <\\/H2> <P> In the late 1990s , the Sydney Opera House Trust resumed communication with Utzon in an attempt to effect a reconciliation and to secure his involvement in future changes to the building . In 1999 , he was appointed by the Trust as a design consultant for future work . <\\/P> The Utzon Room : rebuilt to a design ( and endowed with an original tapestry ) by Utzon <P> In 2004 , the first interior space rebuilt to an Utzon design was opened , and renamed `` The Utzon Room '' in his honour . It contains an original Utzon tapestry ( 14.00 x 3.70 metres ) called Homage to Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach . In April 2007 , he proposed a major reconstruction of the Opera Theatre , as it was then known . Utzon died on 29 November 2008 . <\\/P> <P> A state memorial service , attended by Utzon 's son Jan and daughter Lin , celebrating his creative genius , was held in the Concert Hall on 25 March 2009 featuring performances , readings and recollections from prominent figures in the Australian performing arts scene . <\\/P> <P> Refurbished Western Foyer and Accessibility improvements were commissioned on 17 November 2009 , the largest building project completed since Utzon was re-engaged in 1999 . Designed by Utzon and his son Jan , the project provided improved ticketing , toilet and cloaking facilities . New escalators and a public lift enabled enhanced access for the disabled and families with prams . The prominent paralympian athlete Louise Sauvage was announced as the building 's `` accessibility ambassador '' to advise on further improvements to aid people with disabilities . <\\/P> <P> On 29 March 2016 , an original 1959 tapestry by Le Corbusier ( 2.18 x 3.55 metres ) , commissioned by Utzon to be hung in the Sydney Opera House and called Les D\\u00e9s Sont Jet\\u00e9s ( The Dice Are Cast ) , was finally unveiled in situ after being owned by the Utzon family and held at their home in Denmark for over 50 years . The tapestry was bought at auction by the Sydney Opera House in June 2015 . It now hangs in the building 's Western Foyer and is accessible to the public . <\\/P> <P> In the second half of 2017 , the Joan Sutherland Theatre was closed to replace the stage machinery and for other works . The Concert Hall is scheduled for work in 2020 - 2021 . <\\/P> <H2> Public and Commemorative events ( edit ) <\\/H2> <P> In 1993 , Constantine Koukias was commissioned by the Sydney Opera House Trust in association with REM Theatre to compose Icon , a large - scale music theatre piece for the 20th anniversary of the Sydney Opera House <\\/P> <P> During the 2000 Summer Olympics , the venue served as the focal point for the triathlon events . The event had a 1.5 km ( 0.9 mi ) swimming loop at Farm Cove , along with competitions in the neighbouring Royal Botanical Gardens for the cycling and running portions of the event . <\\/P> <P> Since 2013 , a group of residents from the nearby Bennelong Apartments ( better known as ' The Toaster ' ) , calling themselves the Sydney Opera House Concerned Citizens Group , have been campaigning against Forecourt Concerts on the grounds that they exceed noise levels outlined in the development approval ( DA ) . In February 2017 the NSW Department of Planning and the Environment handed down a $15,000 fine to the Sydney Opera House for breach of allowed noise levels at a concert held in November 2015 . However the DA was amended in 2016 to allow an increase in noise levels in the forecourt by 5 decibels . The residents opposing the concerts contend that a new DA should have been filed rather than an amendment . <\\/P> <P> The Sydney Opera House sails formed a graphic projection - screen in a lightshow mounted in connection with the International Fleet Review in Sydney Harbour on 5 October 2013 . <\\/P> <P> On 31 December 2013 , the venue 's 40th anniversary year , a New Year firework display was mounted for the first time in a decade . The Sydney Opera House hosted an event , ' the biggest blind date ' on Friday 21 February 2014 that won an historic Guinness World Record . The longest continuous serving employee was commemorated on June 27th 2018 , for 50 years of service . <\\/P> <H2> Advertising controversy ( edit ) <\\/H2> <P> On 5 October 2018 the Opera House chief executive Louise Herron clashed with Sydney radio commentator Alan Jones who called for her sacking for refusing to allow Racing NSW to use the Opera House sails to advertise The Everest horse race . Within hours , NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian overruled Herron . Two days later , Prime Minister Scott Morrison supported the decision , calling the Opera House `` the biggest billboard Sydney has '' . The NSW Labor party leader , Luke Foley , and senior federal Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese have supported the proposal . The political view is not supported by significant public opinion , with a petition against the advertising collecting over 298,000 names by 9 October 2018 . 235,000 printed petition documents were presented to the NSW parliament in the morning . A survey conducted on 8 October by market research firm Micromex found that 81 % of those surveyed were not supportive of the premier 's direction . <\\/P> <H2> Notable performances ( edit ) <\\/H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> <\\/Td> <Td> This section needs additional citations for verification .

It is a white solid , but impure samples can appear yellowish . It dissolves well in water to give mildly acidic solutions . It is a mild reducing agent . <\\/P> <P> Ascorbic acid exists as two enantiomers ( mirror - image isomers ) , commonly denoted `` L '' ( for `` levo '' ) and `` D '' ( for `` dextro '' ) . The L isomer is the one most often ecountered : it occurs naturally in many foods , and is one form ( `` vitamer '' ) of vitamin C , an essential nutrient for humans and many animals . Deficiency of vitamin C causes scurvy , formerly a major disease of sailors in long sea voyages . It is used in as a food additive and a dietary supplement for its antioxidant properties . The `` D '' form can be made chemical synthesis but has no significant biological role . <\\/P> <H2> Contents <\\/H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 History <\\/Li> <Li> 2 Chemical properties <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Acidity <\\/Li> <Li> 2.2 Salts <\\/Li> <Li> 2.3 Esters <\\/Li> <Li> 2.4 Nucleophilic attack <\\/Li> <Li> 2.5 Oxidation <\\/Li> <Li> 2.6 Other reactions <\\/Li> <\\/Ul> <\\/Li> <Li> 3 Uses <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Food additive <\\/Li> <Li> 3.2 Dietary supplement <\\/Li> <Li> 3.3 Niche , non-food uses <\\/Li> <\\/Ul> <\\/Li> <Li> 4 Synthesis <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Industrial preparation <\\/Li> <Li> 4.2 Determination <\\/Li> <\\/Ul> <\\/Li> <Li> 5 See also <\\/Li> <Li> 6 Notes and references <\\/Li> <Li> 7 Further reading <\\/Li> <Li> 8 External links <\\/Li> <\\/Ul> <H2> History ( edit ) <\\/H2> <P> The antiscorbutic properties of certain foods were demonstrated in the 18th century by James Lind . In 1907 , Axel Holst and Theodor Fr\\u00f8lich discovered that the antiscorbutic factor was a water - soluble chemical substance , distinct from the one that prevented beriberi . Between 1928 to 1932 , Albert Szent - Gy\\u00f6rgyi isolated a candidate for this substance , which he called it `` hexuronic acid '' , first from plants and later from animal adrenal glands . In 1932 Charles Glen King confirmed that it was indeed the antiscorbutic factor . <\\/P> <P> In 1933 , sugar chemist Walter Norman Haworth , working with samples of `` hexuronic acid '' that Szent - Gy\\u00f6rgyi had isolated from paprika and sent him in the previous year , deduced the correct structure and optical - isomeric nature of the compound , and in 1934 reported its first synthesis . In reference to the compound 's antiscorbutic properties , Haworth and Szent - Gy\\u00f6rgyi proposed to rename it `` a-scorbic acid '' for the compound , and later specifically L - ascorbic acid . Because of their work , in 1937 the Nobel Prizes for chemistry and medicine were awarded to Haworth and Szent - Gy\\u00f6rgyi , respectively . <\\/P> <H2> Chemical properties ( edit ) <\\/H2> <H3> Acidity ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> Ascorbic acid is a vinylogous carboxylic acid and forms the ascorbate anion when deprotonated on one of the hydroxyls . This property is characteristic of reductones : enediols with a carbonyl group adjacent to the enediol group , namely with the group -- C ( OH ) = C ( OH ) -- C ( = O ) -- . The ascorbate anion is stabilized by electron delocalization that results from resonance between two forms : <\\/P> <Dl> <Dd> <\\/Dd> <\\/Dl> <P> For this reason , ascorbic acid is much more acidic than would be expected if the compound contained only isolated hydroxyl groups . <\\/P> <H3> Salts ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> The ascorbate anion forms salts , such as sodium ascorbate , calcium ascorbate , and potassium ascorbate . <\\/P> <H3> Esters ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> Ascorbic acid can also react with organic acids as an alcohol forming esters such as ascorbyl palmitate and ascorbyl stearate . <\\/P> <H3> Nucleophilic attack ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> Nucleophilic attack of ascorbic acid on a proton results in a 1 , 3 - diketone : <\\/P> <Dl> <Dd> <\\/Dd> <\\/Dl> <H3> Oxidation ( edit ) <\\/H3> Semidehydroascorbate acid radical Dehydroascorbic acid <P> The ascorbate ion is the predominant species at typical biological pH values . It is a mild reducing agent and antioxidant . It is oxidized with loss of one electron to form a radical cation and then with loss of a second electron to form dehydroascorbic acid . It typically reacts with oxidants of the reactive oxygen species , such as the hydroxyl radical . <\\/P> <P> Ascorbic acid is special because it can transfer a single electron , owing to the resonance - stabilized nature of its own radical ion , called semidehydroascorbate . The net reaction is : <\\/P> <Dl> <Dd> RO + C O \\u2192 RO + C H O \\u2192 ROH + C H O <\\/Dd> <\\/Dl> <P> On exposure to oxygen , ascorbic acid will undergo further oxidative decomposition to various products including diketogulonic acid , xylonic acid , threonic acid and oxalic acid . <\\/P> <P> Reactive oxygen species are damaging to animals and plants at the molecular level due to their possible interaction with nucleic acids , proteins , and lipids . Sometimes these radicals initiate chain reactions . Ascorbate can terminate these chain radical reactions by electron transfer . The oxidized forms of ascorbate are relatively unreactive and do not cause cellular damage . <\\/P> <P> However , being a good electron donor , excess ascorbate in the presence of free metal ions can not only promote but also initiate free radical reactions , thus making it a potentially dangerous pro-oxidative compound in certain metabolic contexts . <\\/P> <P> Ascorbic acid and its sodium , potassium , and calcium salts are commonly used as antioxidant food additives . These compounds are water - soluble and , thus , can not protect fats from oxidation : For this purpose , the fat - soluble esters of ascorbic acid with long - chain fatty acids ( ascorbyl palmitate or ascorbyl stearate ) can be used as food antioxidants . <\\/P> <H3> Other reactions ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> It creates volatile compounds when mixed with glucose and amino acids in 90 \\u00b0 C . <\\/P> <P> It is a cofactor in tyrosine oxidation . <\\/P> <H2> Uses ( edit ) <\\/H2> <H3> Food additive ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> The main use of L - ascorbic acid and its salts is as food additives , mostly to combat oxidation . It is approved for this purpose in the EU with E number E300 , USA , , Australia , and New Zealand ) <\\/P> <H3> Dietary supplement ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> Another major use of L - ascorbic acid is as dietary supplement . <\\/P> <H3> Niche , non-food uses ( edit ) <\\/H3> <Ul> <Li> Ascorbic acid is easily oxidized and so is used as a reductant in photographic developer solutions ( among others ) and as a preservative . <\\/Li> <Li> In fluorescence microscopy and related fluorescence - based techniques , ascorbic acid can be used as an antioxidant to increase fluorescent signal and chemically retard dye photobleaching . <\\/Li> <Li> It is also commonly used to remove dissolved metal stains , such as iron , from fiberglass swimming pool surfaces . <\\/Li> <Li> In plastic manufacturing , ascorbic acid can be used to assemble molecular chains more quickly and with less waste than traditional synthesis methods . <\\/Li> <Li> Heroin users are known to use ascorbic acid as a means to convert heroin base to a water - soluble salt so that it can be injected . <\\/Li> <Li> As justified by its reaction with iodine , it is used to negate the effects of iodine tablets in water purification . It reacts with the sterilized water , removing the taste , color , and smell of the iodine . This is why it is often sold as a second set of tablets in most sporting goods stores as Portable Aqua - Neutralizing Tablets , along with the potassium iodide tablets . <\\/Li> <Li> Intravenous high - dose ascorbate is being used as a chemotherapeutic and biological response modifying agent . Currently it is still under clinical trials . <\\/Li> <\\/Ul> <H2> Synthesis ( edit ) <\\/H2> <P> Natural biosynthesis of vitamin C occurs in many plants , and animals , by a variety of processes . <\\/P> <H3> Industrial preparation ( edit ) <\\/H3> The outdated , but historically important industrial synthesis of ascorbic acid from glucose via the Reichstein process . <P> Eighty percent of the world 's supply of ascorbic acid is produced in China . Ascorbic acid is prepared in industry from glucose in a method based on the historical Reichstein process . In the first of a five - step process , glucose is catalytically hydrogenated to sorbitol , which is then oxidized by the microorganism Acetobacter suboxydans to sorbose . Only one of the six hydroxy groups is oxidized by this enzymatic reaction . From this point , two routes are available . Treatment of the product with acetone in the presence of an acid catalyst converts four of the remaining hydroxyl groups to acetals . The unprotected hydroxyl group is oxidized to the carboxylic acid by reaction with the catalytic oxidant TEMPO ( regenerated by sodium hypochlorite -- bleaching solution ) . Historically , industrial preparation via the Reichstein process used potassium permanganate as the bleaching solution . Acid - catalyzed hydrolysis of this product performs the dual function of removing the two acetal groups and ring - closing lactonization . This step yields ascorbic acid . Each of the five steps has a yield larger than 90 % . <\\/P> <P> A more biotechnological process , first developed in China in the 1960s , but further developed in the 1990s , bypasses the use of acetone - protecting groups . A second genetically modified microbe species , such as mutant Erwinia , among others , oxidises sorbose into 2 - ketogluconic acid ( 2 - KGA ) , which can then undergo ring - closing lactonization via dehydration . This method is used in the predominant process used by the ascorbic acid industry in China , which supplies 80 % of world 's ascorbic acid . American and Chinese researchers are competing to engineer a mutant that can carry out a one - pot fermentation directly from glucose to 2 - KGA , bypassing both the need for a second fermentation and the need to reduce glucose to sorbitol . <\\/P> <P> There exists a D - ascorbic acid , which does not occur in nature but can be synthesized artificially . To be specific , L - ascorbate is known to participate in many specific enzyme reactions that require the correct enantiomer ( L - ascorbate and not D - ascorbate ) . L - Ascorbic acid has a specific rotation of ( \\u03b1 ) = + 23 \\u00b0 . <\\/P> <H3> Determination ( edit ) <\\/H3> <P> The traditional way to analyze the ascorbic acid content is the process of titration with an oxidizing agent , and several procedures have been developed . <\\/P> <P> The popular iodometry approach uses iodine in the presence of a starch indicator . Iodine is reduced by ascorbic acid , and , when all the ascorbic acid has reacted , the iodine is then in excess , forming a blue - black complex with the starch indicator . This indicates the end - point of the titration . <\\/P> <P> As an alternative , ascorbic acid can be treated with iodine in excess , followed by back titration with sodium thiosulfate using starch as an indicator . <\\/P> <P> This iodometric method has been revised to exploit reaction of ascorbic acid with iodate and iodide in acid solution . Electrolyzing the solution of potassium iodide produces iodine , which reacts with ascorbic acid . The end of process is determined by potentiometric titration in a manner similar to Karl Fischer titration . The amount of ascorbic acid can be calculated by Faraday 's law . <\\/P> <P> Another alternative uses N - bromosuccinimide ( NBS ) as the oxidizing agent , in the presence of potassium iodide and starch . The NBS first oxidizes the ascorbic acid ; when the latter is exhausted , the NBS liberates the iodine from the potassium iodide , which then forms the blue - black complex with starch . <\\/P> <H2> See also ( edit ) <\\/H2> <Ul> <Li> Colour retention agent <\\/Li> <Li> Erythorbic acid : a diastereomer of ascorbic acid . <\\/Li> <Li> Mineral ascorbates : salts of ascorbic acid <\\/Li> <Li> Acids in wine <\\/Li> <\\/Ul> <H2> Notes and references ( edit ) <\\/H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Safety ( MSDS ) data for ascorbic acid .
